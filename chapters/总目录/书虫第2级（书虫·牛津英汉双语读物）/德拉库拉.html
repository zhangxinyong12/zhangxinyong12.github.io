<p class="normaltext3">In the spring of 1875, Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania, on a business visit to the home of Count Dracula. Jonathan does not really want to go because in a few months' time he is getting married to his beautiful Mina, and he does not want to leave her.</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext3">While he is staying in Castle Dracula, he keeps a diary. And every day he has more and more terrible things to write. Why does he see Count Dracula only at night? Why can't he see the Count in the mirror? And who are the three beautiful women, with their red mouths and long sharp teeth, that come to his room at night?</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext3">At home in England, Mina is staying with her friend Lucy in a town by the sea. She waits for Jonathan's letters, but they do not come, and Mina is afraid. Perhaps Jonathan is ill, or in danger...</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext3">Mina is not afraid for herself, of course, or for her friend Lucy. What danger can there possibly be for two young women in a quiet English seaside town?</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj1"><span class="underline">1</span><br/>Count Dracula</h2>
<p class="normaltext">My story begins about seven years ago, in 1875. My name is Jonathan Harker, and I live and work in London. My job is to buy and sell houses for other people. One day a letter arrived for me from a very rich man who lived in Transylvania. He wanted to buy a house in England and he needed my help. The man was Count Dracula, and I agreed to help him.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I found a house for him, and he asked me to take all the papers for it to Transylvania. I was not very pleased about this. I was planning to get married in the autumn, and I did not want to leave my beautiful Mina.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'But you must go, Jonathan,' she said. 'The Count is rich, and perhaps he will give you more work later.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">So I agreed to go. I did not know then of the terrible danger which waited for me in Transylvania.</p>
<p class="normaltext">And so, on 4th May I arrived at a little town called Bistritz. Transylvania was a strange and beautiful country. There were mountains, trees and rivers everywhere. And somewhere high in the mountains was the Count's home, Castle Dracula. I had six hours to wait before the coach came to take me there, so I went into a little hotel. Inside the hotel it was warm and friendly. The people there were all laughing and talking. 'Where are you going?' they asked me.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'To Castle Dracula,' I replied.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Suddenly the room was silent and everyone turned to look at me. I could not understand why they all looked afraid.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Don't go there,' someone said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'But I have to,' I answered. 'It's business.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">They began to talk again, but they were no longer laughing. Slowly, the hotel keeper's wife took the gold cross from her neck and put it into my hand. 'Take this,' she said. 'There is danger at Castle Dracula. Perhaps this will help you.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When the coach arrived and I got into it, a crowd of people came to watch, and I heard the word 'vampire'.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The coach travelled up into the mountains. Higher and higher it went, faster and faster. The sun was bright, but above the trees there was snow on the mountain tops. Then suddenly. the sun went down behind the mountains and everywhere was dark. In the forest around us, the wolves were howling. It was a terrible sound.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Suddenly the coach stopped. A small carriage came down the narrow road on the right. Four black horses were pulling it, and the driver was dressed in black, with a black hat pulled down over his face.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Where's the Englishman?' he called. 'I've come from Castle Dracula!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">He looked strange, standing there in the moonlight, and suddenly I was afraid. But it was too late. I could not go back now.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Soon we were on our way to Castle Dracula. The mountains were all around us and the moon was behind black clouds. I could see nothing—but I could still hear the wolves. The horses went faster and faster, and the driver laughed wildly.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Suddenly the carriage stopped. I opened the door and got out. At once the carriage drove away and I was alone in front of the dark, silent castle. I stood there, looking up at it, and slowly, the big wooden door opened. A tall man stood in front of me. His hair was white and he was dressed in black from head to foot.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Come in, Mr Harker,' he said. 'I am Count Dracula.' He held out his hand and I took it. It was as cold as ice!</p>
<p class="normaltext">I went into the castle and the Count carefully locked the door behind me. He put the key into his pocket and turned to go upstairs. I followed him, and we came to a room where a wood fire burned brightly. In front of it there was a little table with food and drink on it. The Count asked me to sit down and eat, but he did not eat with me. Later, we sat and talked by the fire. His English was very good, and while we talked, I had time to look at him carefully. His face was very white, his ears were like the ears of a cat, and his teeth were strong like the teeth of an animal. There was hair on his hands and his fingers were very long. When he touched me, I was afraid.</p>
<p class="normaltext">It was nearly morning when I went to bed, and outside, the wolves were still howling.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The next morning I found my breakfast on the little table in front of the fire. Now that it was light, I could see that Castle Dracula was old and dirty. I saw no servants all that day.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The Count did not come to breakfast, but there was a letter from him on the table.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Go anywhere in the castle,' it said, 'but some of the rooms are locked. Do not try to go into these rooms.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When the Count came back in the evening, he wanted to know all about his new house in England.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Well,' I began, 'it's a very big house, old and dark, with a high wall all round it. There are trees everywhere. That's why the house is dark. It has a little church too.' And I showed him some pictures of it.</p>
<p class="normaltext">He was pleased about the church. 'Ah,' he said, 'so I shall be near the dead.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">We talked for a long time and once I fell asleep. I woke up suddenly and found the Count's face near me. The smell which came from him was terrible. It was the smell of death.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'You're tired,' the Count said. 'Go to bed now.' And when he smiled, his face was the face of a wolf.</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext3">Our business was now finished. The Count had all the papers for his new house, and there was nothing to keep me in Transylvania or in Castle Dracula, but the Count did not want me to leave. I was alone with him in the castle, but I never saw him in the daytime. I only saw him at night when he came and sat with me. We always talked until the morning and he asked me many questions about England. 'I have plans to go there myself soon,' he said. 'Tell me about sending things to England by ship.' So we talked about ships and the sea, and I thought about Mina, and her friend Lucy. Lucy and her mother were staying by the sea, and Mina was planning to visit them there some time. Stupidly, I told the Count about them.</p>
<p class="normaltext">There was no mirror in my bedroom, but I had one with me, a present from Mina. One morning I was standing in front of it and I was shaving. Suddenly a hand touched me and a voice said, 'Good morning.' The Count was standing next to me. He was standing next to me, <span class="xt">but I could not see him in the mirror!</span></p>
<p class="normaltext">My hand shook and I cut myself. Blood began to run down my face and I saw that Count Dracula was watching it hungrily. Suddenly he put out his hand. He had a wild look in his eyes, and I was afraid. But his hand touched the gold cross at my neck and his face changed. He took the mirror from me, went to the window, and a minute later the mirror was lying in a thousand pieces far below. He did not speak, but left the room quickly. And I stood there, and asked myself <span class="xt">why</span> I could not see this man in the mirror.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I went over to the window and looked out. I was high above the ground. Many of the doors in the castle were locked. Suddenly, I understood. I was a prisoner!</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj1"><span class="underline">1</span><br/>Count Dracula</h2>
<p class="normaltext">My story begins about seven years ago, in 1875. My name is Jonathan Harker, and I live and work in London. My job is to buy and sell houses for other people. One day a letter arrived for me from a very rich man who lived in Transylvania. He wanted to buy a house in England and he needed my help. The man was Count Dracula, and I agreed to help him.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I found a house for him, and he asked me to take all the papers for it to Transylvania. I was not very pleased about this. I was planning to get married in the autumn, and I did not want to leave my beautiful Mina.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'But you must go, Jonathan,' she said. 'The Count is rich, and perhaps he will give you more work later.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">So I agreed to go. I did not know then of the terrible danger which waited for me in Transylvania.</p>
<p class="normaltext">And so, on 4th May I arrived at a little town called Bistritz. Transylvania was a strange and beautiful country. There were mountains, trees and rivers everywhere. And somewhere high in the mountains was the Count's home, Castle Dracula. I had six hours to wait before the coach came to take me there, so I went into a little hotel.

            <h2 class="title2" id="mllj1">1．德拉库拉伯爵</h2>
<p class="normaltext">我的故事发生在大约七年前，也就是1875年。我叫乔纳森·哈克，在伦敦生活和工作，我的职业就是替别人买卖房屋。一天，我收到了一个住在特兰西瓦尼亚的富翁的来信。他想在英国买幢房子，需要我帮忙。这个人就是德拉库拉伯爵，我答应帮助他。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我帮他找到了一幢房子，他让我带着所有跟这幢房子有关的文件去特兰西瓦尼亚。对此我很不乐意，因为我计划秋天结婚，我不想离开我美丽的明娜。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“但你必须去，乔纳森，”明娜说，“伯爵非常有钱，或许以后他会给你更多的工作。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">因此我就答应去了。那时，我并没有意识到一种可怕的危险正在特兰西瓦尼亚等着我。</p>
<p class="normaltext">于是5月4日，我到达了一个叫毕斯特里兹的小镇。特兰西瓦尼亚是个奇怪而美丽的国家。到处山峦起伏，树木葱郁，河流纵横。山中有一处高高耸立的地方就是伯爵的家，德拉库拉城堡。我必须等六个小时才能有马车来接我去那里，所以我就进了一家小旅馆。里面一派温暖祥和的气氛，那里的人们又说又笑，好不热闹。“你要去哪儿？”他们问我。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“去德拉库拉城堡。”我回答说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">屋内顿时一片寂静，人们都转过身来看着我。我不明白为什么他们看起来如此害怕。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“别去那儿。”有人说道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“但我不能不去，”我回答道，“是公事。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他们又开始说话，但不再有人大笑了。旅店的老板娘慢慢地摘下脖子上的金十字架，把它放到我的手里。“拿着这个，”她说，“在德拉库拉城堡有危险，也许这个能对你有点儿帮助。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">马车终于来了，当我坐进去时，一群人出来观看，我听到有人说“吸血鬼”这个词。</p>
<p class="normaltext">马车径直朝山上驶去，越走越高，也越走越快。这里阳光明媚，但树木上方的山顶上却是白雪皑皑。然后突然太阳落山了，四周一片黑暗。周围的森林里，传来狼嚎的声音，非常可怕。</p>
<p class="normaltext">忽然马车停了下来。一辆小型四轮马车从右边狭窄的山路上驶下来。拉车的是四匹黑马，车夫也身着黑衣，一顶黑色的帽子拉下来遮住了他的脸。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“那个英国人在哪儿？”他喊道，“我是从德拉库拉城堡来的！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他站在月光下，看起来很怪异，我突然感到一阵恐惧。但已经太晚了，我现在已无法返回。</p>
<p class="normaltext">很快我们就上路直奔德拉库拉城堡。四周全是山，月亮被乌云遮蔽。我什么也看不见——但我仍能听到狼嚎的声音。马跑得越来越快，车夫大声狂笑着。</p>
<p class="normaltext">车突然停了。我打开门下了车。马车立刻就离开了，我被独自留在这个漆黑死寂的城堡前。我站在那儿，抬头望着城堡，这时那扇巨大的木门慢慢打开了。一个身材高大的男人站在我的面前。他满头白发，却从头到脚一身黑衣。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“请进，哈克先生，”他说，“我就是德拉库拉伯爵。”他伸出手，我握了一下。他的手冰凉！</p>
<p class="normaltext">我一走进城堡，伯爵就在我身后小心地把门锁上了。他把钥匙放进口袋，转身上楼。我跟着他来到一间屋里，壁炉里一堆柴火烧得正旺。炉火前面的一张桌子上摆着食物和饮料。伯爵让我坐下来吃点儿东西，而他却不和我一块儿用餐。后来我们就坐在火边谈话。他英语说得非常好，我们说话时，我也有了时间仔细打量他。他脸色苍白，耳朵有点儿像猫，牙齿却如野兽般锋利。他的手毛茸茸的，手指非常长。他碰到我时，我有些害怕。</p>
<p class="normaltext">天快亮时，我才去睡觉，外面，狼依然在嚎叫着。</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天早晨，我发现早餐已放在炉火前的小桌上了。这时天已大亮，可以看出德拉库拉城堡又旧又脏。我一整天也没看见一个用人。</p>
<p class="normaltext">伯爵没有来吃早点，但桌上放着他写的一封信。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“你可以在城堡四处走走，”信上说，“但有些屋子是锁着的，不要试图进去。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">伯爵晚上回来后，想了解一下他英国的新房子的一切情况。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“嗯，”我说，“那是幢又大又暗的老房子，四周有高墙。到处都是树木，这也正是房子暗的原因。院里还有一个小小的教堂。”我让他看了房子的一些照片。</p>
<p class="normaltext">他对那座小教堂很满意。“啊，”他说，“这样我就可以离死人近些了。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们聊了很长时间，有那么一会儿我还睡着了。我忽然醒来，发现伯爵的脸离我非常近。他身上的气味令人难以忍受，那是一种死亡的气息。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“你累了，”伯爵说，“现在睡觉去吧。”他笑的时候，脸特别像狼的脸。</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext">此时我们的生意已经谈完了。伯爵拿到了有关新房子的所有文件，我没什么理由继续留在特兰西瓦尼亚或德拉库拉城堡了，但伯爵并不想让我离开。只有我一个人和他待在城堡里，但我从未在白天见过他。只有晚上他过来和我聊天时，我才能见到他。我们总是谈到天亮，他问了我好多关于英国的问题。“我打算最近就去那儿。”他说，“告诉我如何用船把东西运往英国。”因此我们谈到了船和大海，我想到了明娜和她的朋友露西。露西正和她母亲住在海边，明娜也正打算去那儿拜访她们，和她们一起待上一段时间。我真愚蠢，居然把这些都告诉了伯爵。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我的卧室里没有镜子，但我带着一面小镜子，那是明娜送给我的。一天清晨，我正在镜子前刮胡子，突然一只手拍了拍我，有个声音说，“早上好。”伯爵站在我旁边。他就站在我旁边，<span class="xx">但我在镜子里却看不见他</span>！</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07698.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">我手一哆嗦，脸就划破了。鲜血顺着我的脸颊淌了下来，我注意到伯爵贪婪地盯着我的血。突然他伸出手来，眼中露出狰狞的目光，我害怕极了。但他的手碰到了我脖子上的金十字架，脸色一下子就变了。他从我手里夺过那面镜子，走到窗前，把它扔了出去，镜子一下子便远远地摔到地上成了碎片。他什么也没有说，便迅速离开了屋子。我站在那儿心里嘀咕，我<span class="xx">为什么</span>在镜子里看不到他。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我走到窗边向外望去。我待的地方离地面很高，城堡里的门有很多都是锁着的。忽然间，我意识到，自己现在已是个囚犯！</p>
<div style="page-break-after:always"></div><p class="fy"></p>
<h2 class="title2" id="mllj2"><span class="underline">2</span><br/>I am in danger</h2>
<p class="normaltext">One evening the Count said, 'You must write to your London office and tell Mr Hawkin that you'll be here for another month.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When I heard this, I went cold. Another month! But what could I do? I worked for Mr Hawkin, and the Count's business was important to him, so if the Count needed me, then I had to stay. I wrote my letter, but I knew that the Count planned to read it. I could not tell Mr Hawkin that I was a prisoner in Castle Dracula!</p>
<p class="normaltext">That evening the Count did not stay and talk with me, but before he left the room, he turned to me and said, 'My young friend, sleep only in this room or your bedroom. You must never fall asleep in any other room in the castle. You will be in danger if you do.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When he left, I went to my room, but I could not rest and began to walk round the castle. Many of the doors were locked, but I found one which was open. I pushed back the door and saw that there was a window in the room. It was a beautiful night and the mountains looked wonderful in the soft yellow light of the moon. Suddenly, something moved below me. It was the Count. Slowly, he came out of the window—first those hands, like the hands of an animal, and then his head. He began to move down the wall, <span class="xt">head first</span>. With his black cloak around him, he looked like a horrible black bird—and my blood ran cold. What <span class="xt">was</span> Count Dracula?</p>
<p class="normaltext">I shivered, and sat down for a minute. The room was warm and friendly. I think that many years ago it was a room for the ladies of the castle, and I decided not to go back to my cold, dark room, but to sleep in this room. So I lay down and closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Suddenly I felt that I was not alone. In the moonlight from the window I saw three beautiful young women. They were watching me, and talking quietly. 'He is young and strong,' one of them said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Yes. There are kisses for all of us,' another answered.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I was excited and afraid. I knew that I wanted those soft red mouths to touch me.</p>
<p class="normaltext">One of the women came nearer. Her strong white teeth touched my neck. I closed my eyes and waited. 'Kiss me! Kiss me!' I thought.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Suddenly there was a cry of anger. It was the Count! He pulled the woman away from me, and her bright blue eyes turned red with a wild anger. I looked at the Count and his eyes were burning with all the fires of hell.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Get off him!' he cried. 'He's not for you! Stay away from him.' A second later, the women were no longer there. They did not leave by the door, but they were no longer there!</p>
<p class="normaltext">I remember no more of that night. When I woke, I was in bed in my room. My gold cross lay on the table next to me, bright in the morning sun.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I knew then that those women were vampires, and that they wanted my blood.</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext3">Two nights later, the Count came to me. 'Write to Mina,' he said. 'Tell her that your work in Transylvania is finished and that you are coming home.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">How pleased I was when I heard this! But then the Count said, 'Say that you are at Bistritz, and put June 29th on the letter.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I shivered when he said this. I knew then that the Count planned to kill me on that day. What could I do? There was nothing. I could only wait and try to escape. But the Count took away all my other clothes and my travel papers, and he locked the door of my room.</p>
<p class="normaltext">A week or two later, I heard noises in the castle, the sound of men working. 'Perhaps one of them will take a letter out of the castle for me,' I thought.</p>
<p class="normaltext">But it was too late! It was already June 29th, and that evening from my window I saw the Count leave the castle, with my letter to Mina in his hand. He was going to post it! I knew that I must do something before it was too late.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Vampires can only come out at night, so I knew that there was no danger during the day. The next morning I decided to visit the Count's room to see what I could find. To do this I had to get into it by the window. This was possible because his room was just below my bedroom, and there were little holes in the wall between the stones. I could put my feet in these, and I could use the heavy curtains from my window to hold onto. It was dangerous, but I had to try.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Slowly I moved down the wall. Once or twice I almost fell, but at last I found myself in the Count's bedroom.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The room was empty. The Count was not there. I looked for the castle keys, but I could not find them. Over in one corner of the room there was some gold, and on the other side of the room there was a big wooden door. It was open and I saw that there were some stairs going down. I went down them, and I came to another door. This was open too, and I found myself in a room with a stone floor. Slowly, I looked around me. There were about fifty wooden boxes in the room. They were coffins, and they were full of earth. In one of them lay the Count! I could not say if he was dead or asleep. His eyes were open and looked cold and stony, but his face did not look like the face of a dead man. His lips were still very red, but he did not move. Slowly I went nearer. I thought perhaps that he had the castle keys on him. But when I looked at those cold, stony eyes, my blood ran cold. Afraid, I turned and ran back to the window. I did not stop to think until I was back in my room.</p>
<p class="normaltext">That night the Count came to me again. 'Tomorrow you will return to England,' he said—and I knew that tomorrow was the day of my death.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I lay down on my bed, but I did not sleep very well. During the night I heard women's voices outside my door, and then the Count, saying, 'Wait. Your time has not yet come. Tomorrow night—you can have him then.' The women laughed, a low, sweet sound, and I shook with fear.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Morning came at last, and I was still alive. 'I must escape,' I thought. But first I had to get the keys.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Once again, I went down the wall and into the Count's room. I ran down the stairs, to the room with the coffins.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The Count was there, in his coffin, but he looked younger and his hair was no longer white. There was blood on his mouth, which ran down across his neck. My hands were shaking, but I had to touch him, to look for the keys. I felt all over his body, but they weren't there. Suddenly I wanted to kill Count Dracula. I took a workman's hammer, and began to bring it down hard on to that horrible, smiling face. But just then the head turned and the Count's burning eyes looked at me. His bloody mouth smiled more horribly than ever. I dropped the hammer and stood there, shaking. What could I do now?</p>
<p class="normaltext">Just then I heard the sound of voices. The workmen were coming back. I hurried back up the stairs to the Count's room. Below, I heard the noise of a key. The workmen were opening a door. So there was another door to the outside down there! I listened carefully, and heard the sound of hammers. They were getting the coffins ready for a journey—perhaps to England! I remembered the Count's words about his plans to visit my country.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I turned to run back downstairs, to find this open door. But I was too late. A cold wind ran through the castle and, with a crash, the door at the top of the stairs closed and locked itself. I could not get back down the stairs.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Soon I saw from the window the heavy carts full of coffins, and the workmen drove away. I was alone in the castle with those terrible vampire women.</p>
<p class="normaltext">While I was writing these words in my diary, I decided what to do. I must try to escape. I shall try to get down the wall outside. The window is high above the ground, but I have to try. I shall take some of the gold with me—if I escape, perhaps it will be helpful later.</p>
<p class="normaltext">If I die, it will be better than the death that waits for me here. Goodbye, Mina! Will I ever see you again?</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj3">2．我身处险境</h2>
<p class="normaltext">一天晚上伯爵说：“你必须给你伦敦的办公室写信，告诉霍金先生你要在这儿再待上一个月。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">听到这句话，我感到浑身冰凉。再待一个月！可我又能怎么办呢？我是为霍金先生工作的，伯爵的生意对于他来说非常重要，所以如果伯爵需要我，那我就必须留下来。于是我写了封信，但我知道伯爵肯定会看。我不能告诉霍金先生我成了德拉库拉城堡中的囚徒！</p>
<p class="normaltext">那天晚上伯爵没有留下来跟我谈活，但他临走前转过身来对我说：“我年轻的朋友，你只能睡在这个房间或你的卧室里。你决不能在城堡的其他任何房间里睡觉，否则你会有危险的。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他一离开，我就到我的房间里去了，但我却无法入睡，于是就在城堡里转来转去。许多门都上着锁，但我发现有一扇门是开着的。我推门而入，看见屋里有一扇窗户。这是个美好的夜晚，群山在柔黄色的月光下显得那么美妙。突然，有什么东西在我下方移动，原来是伯爵。他正慢慢地爬出窗外——先是那双像动物一样的手，然后是他的脑袋。他开始<span class="xx">头朝下地</span>顺着墙向下爬。黑色的斗篷罩在他身上，使他看起来像一只可怕的黑鸟——我吓得浑身发冷。德拉库拉伯爵<span class="xx">到底是</span>什么东西？</p>
<p class="normaltext">我颤抖着坐了一会儿。这间屋子既暖和又舒适。我想多年以前，它应该是城堡里贵妇人的房间，我决定不回我那间又冷又黑的屋子了，而在这间屋里睡觉。于是我躺下来闭上了眼睛。</p>
<p class="normaltext">忽然我感觉自己不是独自一人。在从窗户透进来的月光下，我看见三个漂亮的年轻女子。她们正观察着我，并悄悄地交谈着。“他既年轻又强壮。”其中一个说道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“是的。我们都可以吻他。”另一个回答道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我既兴奋又害怕。我知道我想让那些柔软的红唇吻我。</p>
<p class="normaltext">其中一个女子渐渐走近我。她坚硬而洁白的牙齿触到了我的脖颈。我闭上眼睛等待着。“吻我！吻我！”我在想。</p>
<p class="normaltext">突然传来一声怒吼。是伯爵！他把那女子从我身边拉开，她那明亮的蓝眼睛因狂怒而变得通红。我望着伯爵，他的眼睛里燃烧着地狱之火。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“离开他！”他喊道，“他不是你们的！不要靠近他。”刹那间，那些女子便不见了。她们不是从屋门走出去的，但她们确实已不在那儿了！</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07699.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">那天晚上的其他事情我已记不起来了。当我醒来的时候，我已经躺在自己房间的床上了。我的金十字架放在旁边的桌上，在清晨的阳光下闪闪发光。</p>
<p class="normaltext">现在我知道那些女子是吸血鬼了，她们想吸我的血。</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext">两天之后，伯爵来到我这里。“写信给明娜，”他说道，“告诉她你在特兰西瓦尼亚的工作已经完成了，准备回家。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">当我听到这句话时是多么高兴呀！但接着伯爵说道：“就说你在毕斯特里兹，信上注明6月29号。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他说这句话的时候，我在发抖。我知道伯爵是打算在那天杀死我。可我又能怎么办呢？别无选择。我只能等待时机逃脱。可是伯爵拿走了我其他所有的衣服和旅行证件，并锁上了我的房门。</p>
<p class="normaltext">一两个星期以后，我听到城堡里有喧闹声，是人们干活的声音。“也许他们中有人能帮我把信带出城堡。”我想。</p>
<p class="normaltext">但是太晚了！已经是6月29号了，那天晚上透过窗户我看见伯爵离开了城堡，手里拿着我写给明娜的信。他准备把信寄走！我想我必须在一切还犹为未晚前做点什么。</p>
<p class="normaltext">吸血鬼只能在夜里出来，因此我知道白天不会有危险。第二天早晨我决定去窥探一下伯爵的房间，看看能找到什么。我只有通过窗户才能进到他的房间里去。这是可以做到的，因为他的屋子刚好在我的卧室下面，而且墙上的石头之间都有小洞，我可以把脚放在这些洞里，再抓着窗户上厚厚的窗帘。这很危险，但我必须试一试。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我慢慢地顺着墙向下移动。有那么一两次我差点掉下去，但最后我还是到了伯爵的卧室里。</p>
<p class="normaltext">屋子是空的，伯爵不在屋里。我找了找城堡的钥匙，但没找到。屋子的一个角落里有一些金子，另一边有一扇很大的木门。门是开着的，我看见有楼梯直通到下面。我下了楼梯来到另一扇门前。这扇门也是开着的，我发现自己已经进了一间石头铺地的屋子。我慢慢地环视了一下四周。屋里有大约50个木箱子。是棺材，里面装满了土，而伯爵就躺在其中一个棺材里！我看不出他是死了还是睡着了。他双目圆睁，看起来阴森森的，了无生气，但他的脸却并不像一个死人的脸。他的嘴唇依然是鲜红的，但他一动不动。我慢慢地靠近他。我想也许他身上有城堡的钥匙。但当我看着那双冷酷的眼睛时，我的血都凉了。我吓得转身跑回窗前。直到回到我的屋里，我才喘了口气想了想刚才的事情。</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07700.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">那晚，伯爵又来到我的屋里。“明天你就回英国吧。”他说——但我知道明天就是我的死期。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我躺在床上，但并没有睡好。晚上我听到门外有女人的说话声，然后又听到伯爵说：“等一等，还没到时候呢。明天晚上——他就是你们的了。”女人们笑了起来，声音很低，也很悦耳，我却吓得浑身发抖。</p>
<p class="normaltext">天终于亮了，我仍然活着。“我必须逃跑。”我想。但首先我要拿到钥匙。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我又一次顺着墙爬到伯爵的屋内。我跑下楼梯，来到了放棺材的屋子。</p>
<p class="normaltext">伯爵就躺在他的棺材里，但他看起来年轻了，头发也不再是白的了。他嘴上有血，顺着脖子流下来。我的手开始发抖，但我必须要接触他才能找钥匙。我摸遍了他的全身，但并没有找到钥匙。突然我想杀死德托库拉伯爵。我拿起一把工人用的铁锤，开始向那张可怕的、微笑着的脸使劲砸去。正在这时伯爵的头转了过来，用一双愤怒的眼睛看着我。他血淋淋的嘴笑得比先前更恐怖了。我丢了铁锤站在那里，浑身颤抖。我该怎么办呢？</p>
<p class="normaltext">正在那时，我听到有说话的声音。工人们回来了。我赶紧上楼回到伯爵的房间。我听到了下面有钥匙的响声。工人们正在开门。那么下面还有另外一扇门通到外面的！我仔细听着，好像有锤子的声音。他们正准备把这些棺材运出去——可能是运到英国吧！我记得伯爵说过他打算去我的国家。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我转身朝楼下跑去，想找到这扇开着的门。但我来得太晚了。一股阴风刮过城堡，“嘭”的一声，楼梯上面的门自动关上，锁住了。我无法从楼梯上下去了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">很快我透过窗户看见一辆辆装满棺材的马车，由工人们赶着远去了。只剩下我和那些可怕的女吸血鬼留在城堡里。</p>
<p class="normaltext">当我在日记中写下这些话时，我已经决定怎么做了。我必须设法逃走。我要顺着外面的墙爬下去。窗户离地面很高，但我还是要试一下。我要带上一些金子——如果我能逃脱，或许这些金子以后会有用的。</p>
<p class="normaltext">如果我死了，那也比在这儿等死要好。再见了，明娜！我还能再见到你吗？</p>

            <h2 class="title2" id="mllj1">1．德拉库拉伯爵</h2>
<p class="normaltext">我的故事发生在大约七年前，也就是1875年。我叫乔纳森·哈克，在伦敦生活和工作，我的职业就是替别人买卖房屋。一天，我收到了一个住在特兰西瓦尼亚的富翁的来信。他想在英国买幢房子，需要我帮忙。这个人就是德拉库拉伯爵，我答应帮助他。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我帮他找到了一幢房子，他让我带着所有跟这幢房子有关的文件去特兰西瓦尼亚。对此我很不乐意，因为我计划秋天结婚，我不想离开我美丽的明娜。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“但你必须去，乔纳森，”明娜说，“伯爵非常有钱，或许以后他会给你更多的工作。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">因此我就答应去了。那时，我并没有意识到一种可怕的危险正在特兰西瓦尼亚等着我。</p>
<p class="normaltext">于是5月4日，我到达了一个叫毕斯特里兹的小镇。特兰西瓦尼亚是个奇怪而美丽的国家。到处山峦起伏，树木葱郁，河流纵横。山中有一处高高耸立的地方就是伯爵的家，德拉库拉城堡。我必须等六个小时才能有马车来接我去那里，所以我就进了一家小旅馆。里面一派温暖祥和的气氛，那里的人们又说又笑，好不热闹。“你要去哪儿？”他们问我。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“去德拉库拉城堡。”我回答说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">屋内顿时一片寂静，人们都转过身来看着我。我不明白为什么他们看起来如此害怕。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“别去那儿。”有人说道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“但我不能不去，”我回答道，“是公事。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他们又开始说话，但不再有人大笑了。旅店的老板娘慢慢地摘下脖子上的金十字架，把它放到我的手里。“拿着这个，”她说，“在德拉库拉城堡有危险，也许这个能对你有点儿帮助。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">马车终于来了，当我坐进去时，一群人出来观看，我听到有人说“吸血鬼”这个词。</p>
<p class="normaltext">马车径直朝山上驶去，越走越高，也越走越快。这里阳光明媚，但树木上方的山顶上却是白雪皑皑。然后突然太阳落山了，四周一片黑暗。周围的森林里，传来狼嚎的声音，非常可怕。</p>
<p class="normaltext">忽然马车停了下来。一辆小型四轮马车从右边狭窄的山路上驶下来。拉车的是四匹黑马，车夫也身着黑衣，一顶黑色的帽子拉下来遮住了他的脸。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“那个英国人在哪儿？”他喊道，“我是从德拉库拉城堡来的！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他站在月光下，看起来很怪异，我突然感到一阵恐惧。但已经太晚了，我现在已无法返回。</p>
<p class="normaltext">很快我们就上路直奔德拉库拉城堡。四周全是山，月亮被乌云遮蔽。我什么也看不见——但我仍能听到狼嚎的声音。马跑得越来越快，车夫大声狂笑着。</p>
<p class="normaltext">车突然停了。我打开门下了车。马车立刻就离开了，我被独自留在这个漆黑死寂的城堡前。我站在那儿，抬头望着城堡，这时那扇巨大的木门慢慢打开了。一个身材高大的男人站在我的面前。他满头白发，却从头到脚一身黑衣。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“请进，哈克先生，”他说，“我就是德拉库拉伯爵。”他伸出手，我握了一下。他的手冰凉！</p>
<p class="normaltext">我一走进城堡，伯爵就在我身后小心地把门锁上了。他把钥匙放进口袋，转身上楼。我跟着他来到一间屋里，壁炉里一堆柴火烧得正旺。炉火前面的一张桌子上摆着食物和饮料。伯爵让我坐下来吃点儿东西，而他却不和我一块儿用餐。后来我们就坐在火边谈话。他英语说得非常好，我们说话时，我也有了时间仔细打量他。他脸色苍白，耳朵有点儿像猫，牙齿却如野兽般锋利。他的手毛茸茸的，手指非常长。他碰到我时，我有些害怕。</p>
<p class="normaltext">天快亮时，我才去睡觉，外面，狼依然在嚎叫着。</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天早晨，我发现早餐已放在炉火前的小桌上了。这时天已大亮，可以看出德拉库拉城堡又旧又脏。我一整天也没看见一个用人。</p>
<p class="normaltext">伯爵没有来吃早点，但桌上放着他写的一封信。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“你可以在城堡四处走走，”信上说，“但有些屋子是锁着的，不要试图进去。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">伯爵晚上回来后，想了解一下他英国的新房子的一切情况。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“嗯，”我说，“那是幢又大又暗的老房子，四周有高墙。到处都是树木，这也正是房子暗的原因。院里还有一个小小的教堂。”我让他看了房子的一些照片。</p>
<p class="normaltext">他对那座小教堂很满意。“啊，”他说，“这样我就可以离死人近些了。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们聊了很长时间，有那么一会儿我还睡着了。我忽然醒来，发现伯爵的脸离我非常近。他身上的气味令人难以忍受，那是一种死亡的气息。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“你累了，”伯爵说，“现在睡觉去吧。”他笑的时候，脸特别像狼的脸。</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext">此时我们的生意已经谈完了。伯爵拿到了有关新房子的所有文件，我没什么理由继续留在特兰西瓦尼亚或德拉库拉城堡了，但伯爵并不想让我离开。只有我一个人和他待在城堡里，但我从未在白天见过他。只有晚上他过来和我聊天时，我才能见到他。我们总是谈到天亮，他问了我好多关于英国的问题。“我打算最近就去那儿。”他说，“告诉我如何用船把东西运往英国。”因此我们谈到了船和大海，我想到了明娜和她的朋友露西。露西正和她母亲住在海边，明娜也正打算去那儿拜访她们，和她们一起待上一段时间。我真愚蠢，居然把这些都告诉了伯爵。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我的卧室里没有镜子，但我带着一面小镜子，那是明娜送给我的。一天清晨，我正在镜子前刮胡子，突然一只手拍了拍我，有个声音说，“早上好。”伯爵站在我旁边。他就站在我旁边，<span class="xx">但我在镜子里却看不见他</span>！</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07698.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">我手一哆嗦，脸就划破了。鲜血顺着我的脸颊淌了下来，我注意到伯爵贪婪地盯着我的血。突然他伸出手来，眼中露出狰狞的目光，我害怕极了。但他的手碰到了我脖子上的金十字架，脸色一下子就变了。他从我手里夺过那面镜子，走到窗前，把它扔了出去，镜子一下子便远远地摔到地上成了碎片。他什么也没有说，便迅速离开了屋子。我站在那儿心里嘀咕，我<span class="xx">为什么</span>在镜子里看不到他。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我走到窗边向外望去。我待的地方离地面很高，城堡里的门有很多都是锁着的。忽然间，我意识到，自己现在已是个囚犯！</p>
<div style="page-break-after:always"></div><p class="fy"></p>
<h2 class="title2" id="mllj2"><span class="underline">2</span><br/>I am in danger</h2>
<p class="normaltext">One evening the Count said, 'You must write to your London office and tell Mr Hawkin that you'll be here for another month.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When I heard this, I went cold. Another month! But what could I do? I worked for Mr Hawkin, and the Count's business was important to him, so if the Count needed me, then I had to stay. I wrote my letter, but I knew that the Count planned to read it. I could not tell Mr Hawkin that I was a prisoner in Castle Dracula!</p>
<p class="normaltext">That evening the Count did not stay and talk with me, but before he left the room, he turned to me and said, 'My young friend, sleep only in this room or your bedroom. You must never fall asleep in any other room in the castle. You will be in danger if you do.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When he left, I went to my room, but I could not rest and began to walk round the castle. Many of the doors were locked, but I found one which was open. I pushed back the door and saw that there was a window in the room. It was a beautiful night and the mountains looked wonderful in the soft yellow light of the moon. Suddenly, something moved below me. It was the Count. Slowly, he came out of the window—first those hands, like the hands of an animal, and then his head. He began to move down the wall, <span class="xt">head first</span>. With his black cloak around him, he looked like a horrible black bird—and my blood ran cold. What <span class="xt">was</span> Count Dracula?</p>
<p class="normaltext">I shivered, and sat down for a minute. The room was warm and friendly. I think that many years ago it was a room for the ladies of the castle, and I decided not to go back to my cold, dark room, but to sleep in this room. So I lay down and closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Suddenly I felt that I was not alone. In the moonlight from the window I saw three beautiful young women. They were watching me, and talking quietly. 'He is young and strong,' one of them said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Yes. There are kisses for all of us,' another answered.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I was excited and afraid. I knew that I wanted those soft red mouths to touch me.</p>
<p class="normaltext">One of the women came nearer. Her strong white teeth touched my neck. I closed my eyes and waited. 'Kiss me! Kiss me!' I thought.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Suddenly there was a cry of anger. It was the Count! He pulled the woman away from me, and her bright blue eyes turned red with a wild anger. I looked at the Count and his eyes were burning with all the fires of hell.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Get off him!' he cried. 'He's not for you! Stay away from him.' A second later, the women were no longer there. They did not leave by the door, but they were no longer there!</p>
<p class="normaltext">I remember no more of that night. When I woke, I was in bed in my room. My gold cross lay on the table next to me, bright in the morning sun.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I knew then that those women were vampires, and that they wanted my blood.</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext3">Two nights later, the Count came to me. 'Write to Mina,' he said. 'Tell her that your work in Transylvania is finished and that you are coming home.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">How pleased I was when I heard this! But then the Count said, 'Say that you are at Bistritz, and put June 29th on the letter.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I shivered when he said this. I knew then that the Count planned to kill me on that day. What could I do? There was nothing. I could only wait and try to escape. But the Count took away all my other clothes and my travel papers, and he locked the door of my room.</p>
<p class="normaltext">A week or two later, I heard noises in the castle, the sound of men working. 'Perhaps one of them will take a letter out of the castle for me,' I thought.</p>
<p class="normaltext">But it was too late! It was already June 29th, and that evening from my window I saw the Count leave the castle, with my letter to Mina in his hand. He was going to post it! I knew that I must do something before it was too late.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Vampires can only come out at night, so I knew that there was no danger during the day. The next morning I decided to visit the Count's room to see what I could find. To do this I had to get into it by the window. This was possible because his room was just below my bedroom, and there were little holes in the wall between the stones. I could put my feet in these, and I could use the heavy curtains from my window to hold onto. It was dangerous, but I had to try.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Slowly I moved down the wall. Once or twice I almost fell, but at last I found myself in the Count's bedroom.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The room was empty. The Count was not there. I looked for the castle keys, but I could not find them. Over in one corner of the room there was some gold, and on the other side of the room there was a big wooden door. It was open and I saw that there were some stairs going down. I went down them, and I came to another door. This was open too, and I found myself in a room with a stone floor. Slowly, I looked around me. There were about fifty wooden boxes in the room. They were coffins, and they were full of earth. In one of them lay the Count! I could not say if he was dead or asleep. His eyes were open and looked cold and stony, but his face did not look like the face of a dead man. His lips were still very red, but he did not move. Slowly I went nearer. I thought perhaps that he had the castle keys on him. But when I looked at those cold, stony eyes, my blood ran cold. Afraid, I turned and ran back to the window. I did not stop to think until I was back in my room.</p>
<p class="normaltext">That night the Count came to me again. 'Tomorrow you will return to England,' he said—and I knew that tomorrow was the day of my death.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I lay down on my bed, but I did not sleep very well. During the night I heard women's voices outside my door, and then the Count, saying, 'Wait. Your time has not yet come. Tomorrow night—you can have him then.' The women laughed, a low, sweet sound, and I shook with fear.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Morning came at last, and I was still alive. 'I must escape,' I thought. But first I had to get the keys.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Once again, I went down the wall and into the Count's room. I ran down the stairs, to the room with the coffins.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The Count was there, in his coffin, but he looked younger and his hair was no longer white. There was blood on his mouth, which ran down across his neck. My hands were shaking, but I had to touch him, to look for the keys. I felt all over his body, but they weren't there. Suddenly I wanted to kill Count Dracula. I took a workman's hammer, and began to bring it down hard on to that horrible, smiling face. But just then the head turned and the Count's burning eyes looked at me. His bloody mouth smiled more horribly than ever. I dropped the hammer and stood there, shaking. What could I do now?</p>
<p class="normaltext">Just then I heard the sound of voices. The workmen were coming back. I hurried back up the stairs to the Count's room. Below, I heard the noise of a key. The workmen were opening a door. So there was another door to the outside down there! I listened carefully, and heard the sound of hammers. They were getting the coffins ready for a journey—perhaps to England! I remembered the Count's words about his plans to visit my country.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I turned to run back downstairs, to find this open door. But I was too late. A cold wind ran through the castle and, with a crash, the door at the top of the stairs closed and locked itself. I could not get back down the stairs.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Soon I saw from the window the heavy carts full of coffins, and the workmen drove away. I was alone in the castle with those terrible vampire women.</p>
<p class="normaltext">While I was writing these words in my diary, I decided what to do. I must try to escape. I shall try to get down the wall outside. The window is high above the ground, but I have to try. I shall take some of the gold with me—if I escape, perhaps it will be helpful later.</p>
<p class="normaltext">If I die, it will be better than the death that waits for me here. Goodbye, Mina! Will I ever see you again?</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj3">2．我身处险境</h2>
<p class="normaltext">一天晚上伯爵说：“你必须给你伦敦的办公室写信，告诉霍金先生你要在这儿再待上一个月。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">听到这句话，我感到浑身冰凉。再待一个月！可我又能怎么办呢？我是为霍金先生工作的，伯爵的生意对于他来说非常重要，所以如果伯爵需要我，那我就必须留下来。于是我写了封信，但我知道伯爵肯定会看。我不能告诉霍金先生我成了德拉库拉城堡中的囚徒！</p>
<p class="normaltext">那天晚上伯爵没有留下来跟我谈活，但他临走前转过身来对我说：“我年轻的朋友，你只能睡在这个房间或你的卧室里。你决不能在城堡的其他任何房间里睡觉，否则你会有危险的。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他一离开，我就到我的房间里去了，但我却无法入睡，于是就在城堡里转来转去。许多门都上着锁，但我发现有一扇门是开着的。我推门而入，看见屋里有一扇窗户。这是个美好的夜晚，群山在柔黄色的月光下显得那么美妙。突然，有什么东西在我下方移动，原来是伯爵。他正慢慢地爬出窗外——先是那双像动物一样的手，然后是他的脑袋。他开始<span class="xx">头朝下地</span>顺着墙向下爬。黑色的斗篷罩在他身上，使他看起来像一只可怕的黑鸟——我吓得浑身发冷。德拉库拉伯爵<span class="xx">到底是</span>什么东西？</p>
<p class="normaltext">我颤抖着坐了一会儿。这间屋子既暖和又舒适。我想多年以前，它应该是城堡里贵妇人的房间，我决定不回我那间又冷又黑的屋子了，而在这间屋里睡觉。于是我躺下来闭上了眼睛。</p>
<p class="normaltext">忽然我感觉自己不是独自一人。在从窗户透进来的月光下，我看见三个漂亮的年轻女子。她们正观察着我，并悄悄地交谈着。“他既年轻又强壮。”其中一个说道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“是的。我们都可以吻他。”另一个回答道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我既兴奋又害怕。我知道我想让那些柔软的红唇吻我。</p>
<p class="normaltext">其中一个女子渐渐走近我。她坚硬而洁白的牙齿触到了我的脖颈。我闭上眼睛等待着。“吻我！吻我！”我在想。</p>
<p class="normaltext">突然传来一声怒吼。是伯爵！他把那女子从我身边拉开，她那明亮的蓝眼睛因狂怒而变得通红。我望着伯爵，他的眼睛里燃烧着地狱之火。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“离开他！”他喊道，“他不是你们的！不要靠近他。”刹那间，那些女子便不见了。她们不是从屋门走出去的，但她们确实已不在那儿了！</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07699.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">那天晚上的其他事情我已记不起来了。当我醒来的时候，我已经躺在自己房间的床上了。我的金十字架放在旁边的桌上，在清晨的阳光下闪闪发光。</p>
<p class="normaltext">现在我知道那些女子是吸血鬼了，她们想吸我的血。</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext">两天之后，伯爵来到我这里。“写信给明娜，”他说道，“告诉她你在特兰西瓦尼亚的工作已经完成了，准备回家。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">当我听到这句话时是多么高兴呀！但接着伯爵说道：“就说你在毕斯特里兹，信上注明6月29号。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他说这句话的时候，我在发抖。我知道伯爵是打算在那天杀死我。可我又能怎么办呢？别无选择。我只能等待时机逃脱。可是伯爵拿走了我其他所有的衣服和旅行证件，并锁上了我的房门。</p>
<p class="normaltext">一两个星期以后，我听到城堡里有喧闹声，是人们干活的声音。“也许他们中有人能帮我把信带出城堡。”我想。</p>
<p class="normaltext">但是太晚了！已经是6月29号了，那天晚上透过窗户我看见伯爵离开了城堡，手里拿着我写给明娜的信。他准备把信寄走！我想我必须在一切还犹为未晚前做点什么。</p>
<p class="normaltext">吸血鬼只能在夜里出来，因此我知道白天不会有危险。第二天早晨我决定去窥探一下伯爵的房间，看看能找到什么。我只有通过窗户才能进到他的房间里去。这是可以做到的，因为他的屋子刚好在我的卧室下面，而且墙上的石头之间都有小洞，我可以把脚放在这些洞里，再抓着窗户上厚厚的窗帘。这很危险，但我必须试一试。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我慢慢地顺着墙向下移动。有那么一两次我差点掉下去，但最后我还是到了伯爵的卧室里。</p>
<p class="normaltext">屋子是空的，伯爵不在屋里。我找了找城堡的钥匙，但没找到。屋子的一个角落里有一些金子，另一边有一扇很大的木门。门是开着的，我看见有楼梯直通到下面。我下了楼梯来到另一扇门前。这扇门也是开着的，我发现自己已经进了一间石头铺地的屋子。我慢慢地环视了一下四周。屋里有大约50个木箱子。是棺材，里面装满了土，而伯爵就躺在其中一个棺材里！我看不出他是死了还是睡着了。他双目圆睁，看起来阴森森的，了无生气，但他的脸却并不像一个死人的脸。他的嘴唇依然是鲜红的，但他一动不动。我慢慢地靠近他。我想也许他身上有城堡的钥匙。但当我看着那双冷酷的眼睛时，我的血都凉了。我吓得转身跑回窗前。直到回到我的屋里，我才喘了口气想了想刚才的事情。</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07700.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">那晚，伯爵又来到我的屋里。“明天你就回英国吧。”他说——但我知道明天就是我的死期。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我躺在床上，但并没有睡好。晚上我听到门外有女人的说话声，然后又听到伯爵说：“等一等，还没到时候呢。明天晚上——他就是你们的了。”女人们笑了起来，声音很低，也很悦耳，我却吓得浑身发抖。</p>
<p class="normaltext">天终于亮了，我仍然活着。“我必须逃跑。”我想。但首先我要拿到钥匙。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我又一次顺着墙爬到伯爵的屋内。我跑下楼梯，来到了放棺材的屋子。</p>
<p class="normaltext">伯爵就躺在他的棺材里，但他看起来年轻了，头发也不再是白的了。他嘴上有血，顺着脖子流下来。我的手开始发抖，但我必须要接触他才能找钥匙。我摸遍了他的全身，但并没有找到钥匙。突然我想杀死德托库拉伯爵。我拿起一把工人用的铁锤，开始向那张可怕的、微笑着的脸使劲砸去。正在这时伯爵的头转了过来，用一双愤怒的眼睛看着我。他血淋淋的嘴笑得比先前更恐怖了。我丢了铁锤站在那里，浑身颤抖。我该怎么办呢？</p>
<p class="normaltext">正在那时，我听到有说话的声音。工人们回来了。我赶紧上楼回到伯爵的房间。我听到了下面有钥匙的响声。工人们正在开门。那么下面还有另外一扇门通到外面的！我仔细听着，好像有锤子的声音。他们正准备把这些棺材运出去——可能是运到英国吧！我记得伯爵说过他打算去我的国家。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我转身朝楼下跑去，想找到这扇开着的门。但我来得太晚了。一股阴风刮过城堡，“嘭”的一声，楼梯上面的门自动关上，锁住了。我无法从楼梯上下去了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">很快我透过窗户看见一辆辆装满棺材的马车，由工人们赶着远去了。只剩下我和那些可怕的女吸血鬼留在城堡里。</p>
<p class="normaltext">当我在日记中写下这些话时，我已经决定怎么做了。我必须设法逃走。我要顺着外面的墙爬下去。窗户离地面很高，但我还是要试一下。我要带上一些金子——如果我能逃脱，或许这些金子以后会有用的。</p>
<p class="normaltext">如果我死了，那也比在这儿等死要好。再见了，明娜！我还能再见到你吗？</p>

            <h2 class="title2" id="mllj1">1．德拉库拉伯爵</h2>
<p class="normaltext">我的故事发生在大约七年前，也就是1875年。我叫乔纳森·哈克，在伦敦生活和工作，我的职业就是替别人买卖房屋。一天，我收到了一个住在特兰西瓦尼亚的富翁的来信。他想在英国买幢房子，需要我帮忙。这个人就是德拉库拉伯爵，我答应帮助他。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我帮他找到了一幢房子，他让我带着所有跟这幢房子有关的文件去特兰西瓦尼亚。对此我很不乐意，因为我计划秋天结婚，我不想离开我美丽的明娜。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“但你必须去，乔纳森，”明娜说，“伯爵非常有钱，或许以后他会给你更多的工作。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">因此我就答应去了。那时，我并没有意识到一种可怕的危险正在特兰西瓦尼亚等着我。</p>
<p class="normaltext">于是5月4日，我到达了一个叫毕斯特里兹的小镇。特兰西瓦尼亚是个奇怪而美丽的国家。到处山峦起伏，树木葱郁，河流纵横。山中有一处高高耸立的地方就是伯爵的家，德拉库拉城堡。我必须等六个小时才能有马车来接我去那里，所以我就进了一家小旅馆。里面一派温暖祥和的气氛，那里的人们又说又笑，好不热闹。“你要去哪儿？”他们问我。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“去德拉库拉城堡。”我回答说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">屋内顿时一片寂静，人们都转过身来看着我。我不明白为什么他们看起来如此害怕。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“别去那儿。”有人说道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“但我不能不去，”我回答道，“是公事。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他们又开始说话，但不再有人大笑了。旅店的老板娘慢慢地摘下脖子上的金十字架，把它放到我的手里。“拿着这个，”她说，“在德拉库拉城堡有危险，也许这个能对你有点儿帮助。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">马车终于来了，当我坐进去时，一群人出来观看，我听到有人说“吸血鬼”这个词。</p>
<p class="normaltext">马车径直朝山上驶去，越走越高，也越走越快。这里阳光明媚，但树木上方的山顶上却是白雪皑皑。然后突然太阳落山了，四周一片黑暗。周围的森林里，传来狼嚎的声音，非常可怕。</p>
<p class="normaltext">忽然马车停了下来。一辆小型四轮马车从右边狭窄的山路上驶下来。拉车的是四匹黑马，车夫也身着黑衣，一顶黑色的帽子拉下来遮住了他的脸。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“那个英国人在哪儿？”他喊道，“我是从德拉库拉城堡来的！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他站在月光下，看起来很怪异，我突然感到一阵恐惧。但已经太晚了，我现在已无法返回。</p>
<p class="normaltext">很快我们就上路直奔德拉库拉城堡。四周全是山，月亮被乌云遮蔽。我什么也看不见——但我仍能听到狼嚎的声音。马跑得越来越快，车夫大声狂笑着。</p>
<p class="normaltext">车突然停了。我打开门下了车。马车立刻就离开了，我被独自留在这个漆黑死寂的城堡前。我站在那儿，抬头望着城堡，这时那扇巨大的木门慢慢打开了。一个身材高大的男人站在我的面前。他满头白发，却从头到脚一身黑衣。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“请进，哈克先生，”他说，“我就是德拉库拉伯爵。”他伸出手，我握了一下。他的手冰凉！</p>
<p class="normaltext">我一走进城堡，伯爵就在我身后小心地把门锁上了。他把钥匙放进口袋，转身上楼。我跟着他来到一间屋里，壁炉里一堆柴火烧得正旺。炉火前面的一张桌子上摆着食物和饮料。伯爵让我坐下来吃点儿东西，而他却不和我一块儿用餐。后来我们就坐在火边谈话。他英语说得非常好，我们说话时，我也有了时间仔细打量他。他脸色苍白，耳朵有点儿像猫，牙齿却如野兽般锋利。他的手毛茸茸的，手指非常长。他碰到我时，我有些害怕。</p>
<p class="normaltext">天快亮时，我才去睡觉，外面，狼依然在嚎叫着。</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天早晨，我发现早餐已放在炉火前的小桌上了。这时天已大亮，可以看出德拉库拉城堡又旧又脏。我一整天也没看见一个用人。</p>
<p class="normaltext">伯爵没有来吃早点，但桌上放着他写的一封信。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“你可以在城堡四处走走，”信上说，“但有些屋子是锁着的，不要试图进去。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">伯爵晚上回来后，想了解一下他英国的新房子的一切情况。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“嗯，”我说，“那是幢又大又暗的老房子，四周有高墙。到处都是树木，这也正是房子暗的原因。院里还有一个小小的教堂。”我让他看了房子的一些照片。</p>
<p class="normaltext">他对那座小教堂很满意。“啊，”他说，“这样我就可以离死人近些了。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们聊了很长时间，有那么一会儿我还睡着了。我忽然醒来，发现伯爵的脸离我非常近。他身上的气味令人难以忍受，那是一种死亡的气息。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“你累了，”伯爵说，“现在睡觉去吧。”他笑的时候，脸特别像狼的脸。</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext">此时我们的生意已经谈完了。伯爵拿到了有关新房子的所有文件，我没什么理由继续留在特兰西瓦尼亚或德拉库拉城堡了，但伯爵并不想让我离开。只有我一个人和他待在城堡里，但我从未在白天见过他。只有晚上他过来和我聊天时，我才能见到他。我们总是谈到天亮，他问了我好多关于英国的问题。“我打算最近就去那儿。”他说，“告诉我如何用船把东西运往英国。”因此我们谈到了船和大海，我想到了明娜和她的朋友露西。露西正和她母亲住在海边，明娜也正打算去那儿拜访她们，和她们一起待上一段时间。我真愚蠢，居然把这些都告诉了伯爵。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我的卧室里没有镜子，但我带着一面小镜子，那是明娜送给我的。一天清晨，我正在镜子前刮胡子，突然一只手拍了拍我，有个声音说，“早上好。”伯爵站在我旁边。他就站在我旁边，<span class="xx">但我在镜子里却看不见他</span>！</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07698.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">我手一哆嗦，脸就划破了。鲜血顺着我的脸颊淌了下来，我注意到伯爵贪婪地盯着我的血。突然他伸出手来，眼中露出狰狞的目光，我害怕极了。但他的手碰到了我脖子上的金十字架，脸色一下子就变了。他从我手里夺过那面镜子，走到窗前，把它扔了出去，镜子一下子便远远地摔到地上成了碎片。他什么也没有说，便迅速离开了屋子。我站在那儿心里嘀咕，我<span class="xx">为什么</span>在镜子里看不到他。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我走到窗边向外望去。我待的地方离地面很高，城堡里的门有很多都是锁着的。忽然间，我意识到，自己现在已是个囚犯！</p>
<div style="page-break-after:always"></div><p class="fy"></p>
<h2 class="title2" id="mllj2"><span class="underline">2</span><br/>I am in danger</h2>
<p class="normaltext">One evening the Count said, 'You must write to your London office and tell Mr Hawkin that you'll be here for another month.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When I heard this, I went cold. Another month! But what could I do? I worked for Mr Hawkin, and the Count's business was important to him, so if the Count needed me, then I had to stay. I wrote my letter, but I knew that the Count planned to read it. I could not tell Mr Hawkin that I was a prisoner in Castle Dracula!</p>
<p class="normaltext">That evening the Count did not stay and talk with me, but before he left the room, he turned to me and said, 'My young friend, sleep only in this room or your bedroom. You must never fall asleep in any other room in the castle. You will be in danger if you do.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When he left, I went to my room, but I could not rest and began to walk round the castle. Many of the doors were locked, but I found one which was open. I pushed back the door and saw that there was a window in the room. It was a beautiful night and the mountains looked wonderful in the soft yellow light of the moon. Suddenly, something moved below me. It was the Count. Slowly, he came out of the window—first those hands, like the hands of an animal, and then his head. He began to move down the wall, <span class="xt">head first</span>. With his black cloak around him, he looked like a horrible black bird—and my blood ran cold. What <span class="xt">was</span> Count Dracula?</p>
<p class="normaltext">I shivered, and sat down for a minute. The room was warm and friendly. I think that many years ago it was a room for the ladies of the castle, and I decided not to go back to my cold, dark room, but to sleep in this room. So I lay down and closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Suddenly I felt that I was not alone. In the moonlight from the window I saw three beautiful young women. They were watching me, and talking quietly. 'He is young and strong,' one of them said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Yes. There are kisses for all of us,' another answered.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I was excited and afraid. I knew that I wanted those soft red mouths to touch me.</p>
<p class="normaltext">One of the women came nearer. Her strong white teeth touched my neck. I closed my eyes and waited. 'Kiss me! Kiss me!' I thought.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Suddenly there was a cry of anger. It was the Count! He pulled the woman away from me, and her bright blue eyes turned red with a wild anger. I looked at the Count and his eyes were burning with all the fires of hell.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Get off him!' he cried. 'He's not for you! Stay away from him.' A second later, the women were no longer there. They did not leave by the door, but they were no longer there!</p>
<p class="normaltext">I remember no more of that night. When I woke, I was in bed in my room. My gold cross lay on the table next to me, bright in the morning sun.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I knew then that those women were vampires, and that they wanted my blood.</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext3">Two nights later, the Count came to me. 'Write to Mina,' he said. 'Tell her that your work in Transylvania is finished and that you are coming home.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">How pleased I was when I heard this! But then the Count said, 'Say that you are at Bistritz, and put June 29th on the letter.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I shivered when he said this. I knew then that the Count planned to kill me on that day. What could I do? There was nothing. I could only wait and try to escape. But the Count took away all my other clothes and my travel papers, and he locked the door of my room.</p>
<p class="normaltext">A week or two later, I heard noises in the castle, the sound of men working. 'Perhaps one of them will take a letter out of the castle for me,' I thought.</p>
<p class="normaltext">But it was too late! It was already June 29th, and that evening from my window I saw the Count leave the castle, with my letter to Mina in his hand. He was going to post it! I knew that I must do something before it was too late.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Vampires can only come out at night, so I knew that there was no danger during the day. The next morning I decided to visit the Count's room to see what I could find. To do this I had to get into it by the window. This was possible because his room was just below my bedroom, and there were little holes in the wall between the stones. I could put my feet in these, and I could use the heavy curtains from my window to hold onto. It was dangerous, but I had to try.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Slowly I moved down the wall. Once or twice I almost fell, but at last I found myself in the Count's bedroom.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The room was empty. The Count was not there. I looked for the castle keys, but I could not find them. Over in one corner of the room there was some gold, and on the other side of the room there was a big wooden door. It was open and I saw that there were some stairs going down. I went down them, and I came to another door. This was open too, and I found myself in a room with a stone floor. Slowly, I looked around me. There were about fifty wooden boxes in the room. They were coffins, and they were full of earth. In one of them lay the Count! I could not say if he was dead or asleep. His eyes were open and looked cold and stony, but his face did not look like the face of a dead man. His lips were still very red, but he did not move. Slowly I went nearer. I thought perhaps that he had the castle keys on him. But when I looked at those cold, stony eyes, my blood ran cold. Afraid, I turned and ran back to the window. I did not stop to think until I was back in my room.</p>
<p class="normaltext">That night the Count came to me again. 'Tomorrow you will return to England,' he said—and I knew that tomorrow was the day of my death.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I lay down on my bed, but I did not sleep very well. During the night I heard women's voices outside my door, and then the Count, saying, 'Wait. Your time has not yet come. Tomorrow night—you can have him then.' The women laughed, a low, sweet sound, and I shook with fear.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Morning came at last, and I was still alive. 'I must escape,' I thought. But first I had to get the keys.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Once again, I went down the wall and into the Count's room. I ran down the stairs, to the room with the coffins.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The Count was there, in his coffin, but he looked younger and his hair was no longer white. There was blood on his mouth, which ran down across his neck. My hands were shaking, but I had to touch him, to look for the keys. I felt all over his body, but they weren't there. Suddenly I wanted to kill Count Dracula. I took a workman's hammer, and began to bring it down hard on to that horrible, smiling face. But just then the head turned and the Count's burning eyes looked at me. His bloody mouth smiled more horribly than ever. I dropped the hammer and stood there, shaking. What could I do now?</p>
<p class="normaltext">Just then I heard the sound of voices. The workmen were coming back. I hurried back up the stairs to the Count's room. Below, I heard the noise of a key. The workmen were opening a door. So there was another door to the outside down there! I listened carefully, and heard the sound of hammers. They were getting the coffins ready for a journey—perhaps to England! I remembered the Count's words about his plans to visit my country.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I turned to run back downstairs, to find this open door. But I was too late. A cold wind ran through the castle and, with a crash, the door at the top of the stairs closed and locked itself. I could not get back down the stairs.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Soon I saw from the window the heavy carts full of coffins, and the workmen drove away. I was alone in the castle with those terrible vampire women.</p>
<p class="normaltext">While I was writing these words in my diary, I decided what to do. I must try to escape. I shall try to get down the wall outside. The window is high above the ground, but I have to try. I shall take some of the gold with me—if I escape, perhaps it will be helpful later.</p>
<p class="normaltext">If I die, it will be better than the death that waits for me here. Goodbye, Mina! Will I ever see you again?</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj3">2．我身处险境</h2>
<p class="normaltext">一天晚上伯爵说：“你必须给你伦敦的办公室写信，告诉霍金先生你要在这儿再待上一个月。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">听到这句话，我感到浑身冰凉。再待一个月！可我又能怎么办呢？我是为霍金先生工作的，伯爵的生意对于他来说非常重要，所以如果伯爵需要我，那我就必须留下来。于是我写了封信，但我知道伯爵肯定会看。我不能告诉霍金先生我成了德拉库拉城堡中的囚徒！</p>
<p class="normaltext">那天晚上伯爵没有留下来跟我谈活，但他临走前转过身来对我说：“我年轻的朋友，你只能睡在这个房间或你的卧室里。你决不能在城堡的其他任何房间里睡觉，否则你会有危险的。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他一离开，我就到我的房间里去了，但我却无法入睡，于是就在城堡里转来转去。许多门都上着锁，但我发现有一扇门是开着的。我推门而入，看见屋里有一扇窗户。这是个美好的夜晚，群山在柔黄色的月光下显得那么美妙。突然，有什么东西在我下方移动，原来是伯爵。他正慢慢地爬出窗外——先是那双像动物一样的手，然后是他的脑袋。他开始<span class="xx">头朝下地</span>顺着墙向下爬。黑色的斗篷罩在他身上，使他看起来像一只可怕的黑鸟——我吓得浑身发冷。德拉库拉伯爵<span class="xx">到底是</span>什么东西？</p>
<p class="normaltext">我颤抖着坐了一会儿。这间屋子既暖和又舒适。我想多年以前，它应该是城堡里贵妇人的房间，我决定不回我那间又冷又黑的屋子了，而在这间屋里睡觉。于是我躺下来闭上了眼睛。</p>
<p class="normaltext">忽然我感觉自己不是独自一人。在从窗户透进来的月光下，我看见三个漂亮的年轻女子。她们正观察着我，并悄悄地交谈着。“他既年轻又强壮。”其中一个说道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“是的。我们都可以吻他。”另一个回答道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我既兴奋又害怕。我知道我想让那些柔软的红唇吻我。</p>
<p class="normaltext">其中一个女子渐渐走近我。她坚硬而洁白的牙齿触到了我的脖颈。我闭上眼睛等待着。“吻我！吻我！”我在想。</p>
<p class="normaltext">突然传来一声怒吼。是伯爵！他把那女子从我身边拉开，她那明亮的蓝眼睛因狂怒而变得通红。我望着伯爵，他的眼睛里燃烧着地狱之火。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“离开他！”他喊道，“他不是你们的！不要靠近他。”刹那间，那些女子便不见了。她们不是从屋门走出去的，但她们确实已不在那儿了！</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07699.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">那天晚上的其他事情我已记不起来了。当我醒来的时候，我已经躺在自己房间的床上了。我的金十字架放在旁边的桌上，在清晨的阳光下闪闪发光。</p>
<p class="normaltext">现在我知道那些女子是吸血鬼了，她们想吸我的血。</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext">两天之后，伯爵来到我这里。“写信给明娜，”他说道，“告诉她你在特兰西瓦尼亚的工作已经完成了，准备回家。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">当我听到这句话时是多么高兴呀！但接着伯爵说道：“就说你在毕斯特里兹，信上注明6月29号。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">他说这句话的时候，我在发抖。我知道伯爵是打算在那天杀死我。可我又能怎么办呢？别无选择。我只能等待时机逃脱。可是伯爵拿走了我其他所有的衣服和旅行证件，并锁上了我的房门。</p>
<p class="normaltext">一两个星期以后，我听到城堡里有喧闹声，是人们干活的声音。“也许他们中有人能帮我把信带出城堡。”我想。</p>
<p class="normaltext">但是太晚了！已经是6月29号了，那天晚上透过窗户我看见伯爵离开了城堡，手里拿着我写给明娜的信。他准备把信寄走！我想我必须在一切还犹为未晚前做点什么。</p>
<p class="normaltext">吸血鬼只能在夜里出来，因此我知道白天不会有危险。第二天早晨我决定去窥探一下伯爵的房间，看看能找到什么。我只有通过窗户才能进到他的房间里去。这是可以做到的，因为他的屋子刚好在我的卧室下面，而且墙上的石头之间都有小洞，我可以把脚放在这些洞里，再抓着窗户上厚厚的窗帘。这很危险，但我必须试一试。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我慢慢地顺着墙向下移动。有那么一两次我差点掉下去，但最后我还是到了伯爵的卧室里。</p>
<p class="normaltext">屋子是空的，伯爵不在屋里。我找了找城堡的钥匙，但没找到。屋子的一个角落里有一些金子，另一边有一扇很大的木门。门是开着的，我看见有楼梯直通到下面。我下了楼梯来到另一扇门前。这扇门也是开着的，我发现自己已经进了一间石头铺地的屋子。我慢慢地环视了一下四周。屋里有大约50个木箱子。是棺材，里面装满了土，而伯爵就躺在其中一个棺材里！我看不出他是死了还是睡着了。他双目圆睁，看起来阴森森的，了无生气，但他的脸却并不像一个死人的脸。他的嘴唇依然是鲜红的，但他一动不动。我慢慢地靠近他。我想也许他身上有城堡的钥匙。但当我看着那双冷酷的眼睛时，我的血都凉了。我吓得转身跑回窗前。直到回到我的屋里，我才喘了口气想了想刚才的事情。</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07700.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">那晚，伯爵又来到我的屋里。“明天你就回英国吧。”他说——但我知道明天就是我的死期。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我躺在床上，但并没有睡好。晚上我听到门外有女人的说话声，然后又听到伯爵说：“等一等，还没到时候呢。明天晚上——他就是你们的了。”女人们笑了起来，声音很低，也很悦耳，我却吓得浑身发抖。</p>
<p class="normaltext">天终于亮了，我仍然活着。“我必须逃跑。”我想。但首先我要拿到钥匙。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我又一次顺着墙爬到伯爵的屋内。我跑下楼梯，来到了放棺材的屋子。</p>
<p class="normaltext">伯爵就躺在他的棺材里，但他看起来年轻了，头发也不再是白的了。他嘴上有血，顺着脖子流下来。我的手开始发抖，但我必须要接触他才能找钥匙。我摸遍了他的全身，但并没有找到钥匙。突然我想杀死德托库拉伯爵。我拿起一把工人用的铁锤，开始向那张可怕的、微笑着的脸使劲砸去。正在这时伯爵的头转了过来，用一双愤怒的眼睛看着我。他血淋淋的嘴笑得比先前更恐怖了。我丢了铁锤站在那里，浑身颤抖。我该怎么办呢？</p>
<p class="normaltext">正在那时，我听到有说话的声音。工人们回来了。我赶紧上楼回到伯爵的房间。我听到了下面有钥匙的响声。工人们正在开门。那么下面还有另外一扇门通到外面的！我仔细听着，好像有锤子的声音。他们正准备把这些棺材运出去——可能是运到英国吧！我记得伯爵说过他打算去我的国家。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我转身朝楼下跑去，想找到这扇开着的门。但我来得太晚了。一股阴风刮过城堡，“嘭”的一声，楼梯上面的门自动关上，锁住了。我无法从楼梯上下去了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">很快我透过窗户看见一辆辆装满棺材的马车，由工人们赶着远去了。只剩下我和那些可怕的女吸血鬼留在城堡里。</p>
<p class="normaltext">当我在日记中写下这些话时，我已经决定怎么做了。我必须设法逃走。我要顺着外面的墙爬下去。窗户离地面很高，但我还是要试一下。我要带上一些金子——如果我能逃脱，或许这些金子以后会有用的。</p>
<p class="normaltext">如果我死了，那也比在这儿等死要好。再见了，明娜！我还能再见到你吗？</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj1"><span class="underline">3</span><br/>Lucy in danger</h2>
<p class="normaltext">While Jonathan was away, I was very unhappy. He did not write to me often, and when he did, his letters were strange and very short. I knew that something was wrong. But what? Was Jonathan in danger? I thought about him all the time. Why didn't he come back to England and to me?</p>
<p class="normaltext">I felt better when, at last, I did get a letter from him. Jonathan said that he was coming home and was at Bistritz. But again it was a short, strange letter. 'Perhaps he's ill,' I thought.</p>
<p class="normaltext">My friend, Lucy, also wrote to me. 'I know that you will be happy for me,' she wrote. 'Arthur has asked me to marry him! Isn't it wonderful? I love him very much. He's away just now, and you know that Mother and I are staying at Whitby, by the sea. Please come and stay with us, and I can tell you all about it.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Arthur Holmwood loved Lucy very much. I was really pleased to hear her news and I decided to go immediately. And it would help me not to think about Jonathan all the time.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Lucy met me at the station, and it was wonderful to see her again. She was full of life and talked happily of her plans. 'Oh, Mina,' she said to me. 'I am really happy. I love Arthur very much.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">But sometimes it was hard for me, because when Lucy talked of Arthur, I thought of Jonathan again.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The weather was good and Lucy and I walked a lot, sometimes by the sea, but we often went up to the old church on the hill.</p>
<p class="normaltext">At night, Lucy and I slept in one room, but sometimes she walked in her sleep. She began to sleep badly, and her mother and I decided to lock the bedroom door at night.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Then one day the weather changed. The sky was black and heavy, and that night there was a terrible storm. Lucy was very excited by it, and she sat by the window all night and watched the sea.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The next morning there was a ship on the beach.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'It's a Russian ship, from Varna on the Black Sea,' Lucy's servant told us. 'There are coffins on it, and they're full of earth. And a big black dog jumped off the ship and ran up the hill!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'And is everyone on the ship alive?' Lucy asked.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'That's the strange thing about it,' the servant replied. 'There was no one on the ship, either dead or alive.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Everybody in the town was very excited by this strange ship, but there were no answers to the mystery. And nobody saw the big black dog again.</p>
<p class="normaltext">That night I woke up and found that the bedroom door was open and Lucy was not there. I looked for her everywhere in the house, but I could not find her. 'I'm afraid for her, I don't know why,' I said to her mother.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I knew that Lucy sometimes liked to go and sit quietly in the churchyard, so I hurried out into the night to look for her. And I found her. She was sitting in the churchyard, white in the moonlight, and I thought I saw something dark behind her—something dark and horrible. Slowly, its head moved nearer to Lucy. Afraid, I called out, 'Lucy! Lucy!' A white face and burning red eyes looked up at me—and then, nothing! Lucy was alone, asleep in the moonlight. I woke her, and she gave a little cry. She put her hands to her neck, and I saw that there were two little drops of blood there.</p>
<p class="normaltext">After that night Lucy was worse. She left her bed every night and her lovely face was white. I was afraid for her and locked the door at night. And I still did not hear from Jonathan. I was unhappy and did not sleep well myself, so one night I went for a walk alone. 'Lucy will be all right,' I thought. 'The door is locked. She can't get out, and no one can get in.' But when I came back, I found Lucy by the open window. 'Lucy!' I cried. But she did not reply. She was asleep, and near her, just outside the open window, there was something black, like a big bird.</p>
<p class="normaltext">A day or two later, I had a letter. Jonathan was ill and in hospital in Budapest. 'Of course, I must go to him immediately,' I said to Lucy. I did not want to leave her, but Jonathan was everything to me. 'He needs me,' I said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">And when at last I arrived in Budapest and held Jonathan in my arms, I felt happy. Jonathan was very ill but he was getting better every day. He did not want to talk about his time in Castle Dracula, but he gave me his diary to read. And so I learnt about Count Dracula and Jonathan's terrible adventure in the castle. But he escaped! And when he fell ill in the mountains, some workmen found him and took him to the hospital. Poor Jonathan! His face was white and thin, and he was still very afraid, but now we were together again and everything was all right.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Jonathan and I were married on September 1st, and then we began our journey home. We arrived back in England on September 18th, and it was wonderful to be home again. Everyone looked happy on that warm autumn evening, when we drove through the streets of London. Jonathan smiled and said softly, 'Oh Mina, I love you.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'I love you, too, Jonathan,' I replied. I was truly happy.</p>
<p class="normaltext">And then, suddenly, Jonathan's face went white, and he cried out. He was looking at a carriage, outside a shop. In it there was a pretty girl with dark hair. She was waiting for someone. And near the carriage, watching the pretty girl, there was a man—a tall, thin man, with long white teeth and a very red mouth. 'It's the Count!' Jonathan cried. 'Here in London!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Jonathan put his head in his hands and said nothing for the rest of the journey. I was very afraid for him. Was it really true—that this horrible Count Dracula was here in London?</p>
<p class="normaltext">When we arrived home, there was a letter from Arthur Holmwood. Lucy was dead! My dearest Lucy, dead! It could not be true!</p>
<p class="normaltext">Later we read the letter again.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Soon after you left,' Arthur wrote, 'Lucy began to get worse. I did not know what to do. I knew only that I must do something quickly, so I asked our old friend, Jack Seward, to come and see her. "He's a doctor," I thought. "Perhaps he can do something to help Lucy." He came at once, but in the end nobody could help poor Lucy, and she died yesterday.'</p>

<p class="normaltext">When we arrived home, there was a letter from Arthur Holmwood. Lucy was dead! My dearest Lucy, dead! It could not be true!</p>
<p class="normaltext">Later we read the letter again.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Soon after you left,' Arthur wrote, 'Lucy began to get worse. I did not know what to do. I knew only that I must do something quickly, so I asked our old friend, Jack Seward, to come and see her. "He's a doctor," I thought. "Perhaps he can do something to help Lucy." He came at once, but in the end nobody could help poor Lucy, and she died yesterday.'</p>

            <h2 class="title2" id="mllj1">3．露西身处险境</h2>
<p class="normaltext">乔纳森离开的这段时间，我很难过。他总是不给我写信，即使写，也很短、很奇怪。我知道出事了。但出什么事了呢？乔纳森处境危险吗？我一直想着他。为什么他不同到英国、回到我身边呢？</p>
<p class="normaltext">最后，我终于收到了他的一封信，感觉好多了。乔纳森在信中说他就要回来了，正在毕斯特里兹。但这又是一封简短而奇怪的信。“他可能病了。”我想。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我的朋友露西也来信了。“我知道你会为我高兴的，”她写道，“阿瑟向我求婚了！太好了，对吧？我非常爱他。他刚刚离开，你知道我和母亲正住在海边的惠特比。来和我们住一段儿吧，我想把一切都告诉你。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">阿瑟·霍姆伍德深爱着露西。听到她的消息我非常高兴，决定马上就去那儿，这样我就不会老想着乔纳森了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">露西到车站去接我，又看到她真让人高兴。她精神焕发，兴高采烈地谈着她的计划。“噢，明娜，”她对我说，“我真的很兴奋。我太爱阿瑟了。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">但有时，我也很难过，因为当露西谈到阿瑟时，我就又想起了乔纳森。</p>
<p class="normaltext">天气很好，我常和露西出去散步，我们有时去海边，但很多时候都去山上的教堂。</p>
<p class="normaltext">晚上，露西和我同住一屋，但她有时梦游。她开始睡不好觉，我和她母亲决定晚上把卧室的门锁住。</p>
<p class="normaltext">后来有一天，天气突变。天空又阴又暗，那天晚上起了可怕的风暴。露西对此感到很兴奋，她整夜坐在窗前观看着大海。</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天早上，海滩上出现了一艘船。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“那是艘俄国船，来自黑海的瓦尔纳，”露西的仆人告诉我们，“船上都是棺材，里面装满了土。一只大黑狗跳下船，跑到山上去了！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“船上有人活着吗？”露西问。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“这事儿很奇怪，”仆人回答说，“船上没有人，死人活人都没有。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">镇上的人都对这艘奇怪的船很感兴趣，但没人能找到这起神秘事件的答案，也没有人再见过那只大黑狗。</p>
<p class="normaltext">那天夜里，我醒来发现卧室的门开着，露西不见了。我在家里四处找她，但没能找到。“不知为什么，我很为她担心。”我对她母亲说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我知道露西有时喜欢去教堂的庭院中静静地坐着，于是我乘着夜色，匆匆地出去找她。我找到了她。她坐在教堂的庭院里，月光下她显得很苍白。而我好像看到她身后有个黑色的东西——一种黑色而可怕的东西。它的头正慢慢地靠近露西。我吓得大声叫喊：“露西！露西！”它抬起头来，脸色惨白，一双血红的眼睛死盯着我——突然间，一切又都没有了！露西一个人睡在月光下。我叫醒了她，她呻吟了一声。她用手去摸脖子，我看见她脖子上有两点血迹。</p>
<p class="normaltext">那一晚之后，露西的情况更糟了。她每晚都梦游，而且她可爱的脸也愈加苍白。我很为她担心，晚上就把门锁上了。仍然没有乔纳森的消息。我心情不佳，晚上也睡不好，于是一天晚上，我独自出去散步。“露西不会有事的，”我想，“门已经锁上了。她出不来，也没人能进得去。”但当我回来时，却发现露西站在敞开的窗户旁边。“露西！”我大叫。但她没有问答。她还睡着呢，而在她的旁边，就在敞开的窗户外面，有一个黑影，很像一只大鸟。</p>
<p class="normaltext">一两天以后，我收到了一封信。乔纳森病了，住在布达佩斯的一家医院里。“当然，我必须马上去看他。”我对露西说。我不想离开她，但乔纳森是我的一切。“他需要我。”我说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">当我终于到达布达佩斯，把乔纳森抱在怀里的时候，我感到非常高兴。乔纳森病得很重，但他正在一天天好起来。他不想谈他在德拉库拉城堡的那段日子，但他让我读了他的日记。我这才知道了德拉库拉伯爵以及乔纳森在城堡里的可怕经历。但他终于逃脱了！他在山里病倒后，一些工人发现了他，并把他送到了医院。可怜的乔纳森！他的脸苍白而消瘦，他仍然非常害怕，不过现在我们又在一起了，一切都很好。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我和乔纳森9月1日结婚，之后就启程回家。9月18日，我们回到了英国，回到家的感觉真好。在那个秋天温暖的黄昏，我们驾车在伦敦的大街上穿行着，人们看起来都很快乐。乔纳森微笑着轻声说：“哦，明娜，我爱你。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“我也爱你，乔纳森。”我回答说。我真的幸福极了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">随后，突然间，乔纳森的脸变得煞白，大叫了一声。他正盯着一辆停在商店外面的马车看。马车里坐着一位黑头发的漂亮姑娘，她正在等人。马车附近，有个男人，正在注视着这个漂亮女孩——一个瘦高的男人，牙齿又长又白，嘴唇血红。“这就是伯爵！”乔纳森叫道，“他在伦敦！”</p>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07701.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">乔纳森手抱着头，余下的路上一句话也没说。我很为他担心。那是真的吗——那个可怕的德拉库拉伯爵就在伦敦？</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们到家时，收到了阿瑟·霍姆伍德的来信。露西死了！我最亲爱的露西死了！这不可能！</p>
<p class="normaltext">后来，我们又把这封信读了一遍。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“你走后不久，”阿瑟写道，“露西的病情就开始恶化。我不知道该怎么做，只知道必须马上做点儿什么，因此我找了我的朋友杰克·苏厄德来看她。‘他是个医生，’我想，‘或许他能做些什么来帮助露西。’他立刻就来了，但最终没有人能帮上可怜的露西的忙，她在昨天永远地去了。”</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj1"><span class="underline">4</span><br/>Lucy's death</h2>
<p class="normaltext">When I heard from Arthur the terrible news of Lucy's strange illness, I went to her immediately. I could see that she was very ill. She lay in bed all day and did not move. She was as white as a ghost and she was very thin. When night came, she was afraid to sleep, and in the morning, on her neck there were two strange little wounds.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I did not know what was wrong with Lucy. She was losing blood. But how? Was it through these two little wounds in her neck?</p>
<p class="normaltext">I decided to send for my old teacher Professor Van Helsing from Holland. Perhaps he could help.</p>
<p class="normaltext">He came immediately, and when he saw how ill Lucy was, he said, 'We must give her blood at once.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'She can have my blood!' cried Arthur. 'All of it—to the last drop!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Van Helsing was right. With Arthur's blood in her, Lucy began to get better immediately. But before he left, Van Helsing did one more thing. He brought some flowers with a very strong smell, and he put a circle of them round Lucy's neck. 'My dear,' he said, 'these are garlic flowers. Do not take them from your neck tonight, and do not open your window.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Van Helsing had to return to Holland for a few days and before he left, he told us: 'You must watch Lucy every night, and be sure that she wears the garlic flowers.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Lucy's mother was ill herself—her heart was not strong—and Arthur had to go back home because his father was dying. So for a week I watched over Lucy myself at night, and sometimes, when I sat by her bed, I heard strange noises at the window. Perhaps it was a tree, or the wind, I thought.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I was working at my hospital during the day, and after a week I was very tired, so one night I did not go to Lucy's house. I needed to sleep, and I knew that Lucy's mother and the servants were there. Also, Van Helsing sent new garlic flowers every day, for Lucy to wear at night.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The next morning at the hospital I had a note from Van Helsing. 'Watch Lucy carefully tonight,' he wrote. 'I shall be with you tomorrow.' But that was now today! The note was too late!</p>
<p class="normaltext">I did not wait for breakfast, but hurried to the house immediately. I knocked on the door, but there was no answer. Just then Van Helsing arrived.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'What happened?' he cried. 'Did you not get my note? Quick! Perhaps we are already too late!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">We knocked again, but there was still no answer. We went round to the back of the house and Van Helsing broke the kitchen window and we went in.</p>
<p class="normaltext">It was dark in the kitchen, but we could see the bodies of the four servants on the floor. They were not dead, but asleep. 'Someone put something in their drinks,' said Van Helsing. 'Come! We must find Lucy. If we are not too late!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">We ran up to Lucy's room, and stopped outside it. With white faces and shaking hands, we opened the door softly and went into the room.</p>
<p class="normaltext">How can I describe what we saw? The bodies of two women—Lucy and her mother—lay on the bed. The faces of both women were white, and on the mother's face there was a look of terrible fear. In her hand she held the flowers from Lucy's neck, and on the floor there was glass from the broken window.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Van Helsing looked down at the two women. 'The poor mother is dead,' he said. 'But for Lucy it is not too late! Go and wake the servants!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I ran downstairs to wake them. 'Put her in a hot bath,' Van Helsing said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">After a time, Lucy began to show some life, and they took her and put her in a warm bed. From time to time she slept, but she did not fight to stay alive. She could not eat anything, and she was very weak. We sent for Arthur, and when he came, he was very unhappy. His father was now dead, and he could see that Lucy was very, very ill. One of us sat with Lucy all the time, and that night Arthur and Van Helsing slept in the sitting-room, while I watched over Lucy.</p>
<p class="normaltext">When Van Helsing came back up to me at six o'clock, Arthur was still asleep downstairs. Van Helsing went over to Lucy and looked at her. 'The wounds on her neck have gone,' he said. 'She will soon be dead. Bring Arthur.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When Arthur and I came back, Lucy opened her lovely eyes. 'Oh, Arthur,' she said softly. 'Kiss me, my love.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">He moved his head nearer to her, but Van Helsing pulled him back. 'No!' he cried. For a minute, Lucy's face was hard and angry. She opened her mouth, and her teeth looked very long and sharp. Then her eyes closed and she slept. Soon she woke again, took Van Helsing's hand and said softly, 'My true friend.' And then, quietly, Lucy died.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'She's gone,' said Van Helsing, and Arthur put his head in his hands and cried.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Later, I went back into Lucy's room, and Van Helsing and I looked down together at her beautiful face.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Poor girl,' I said. 'It is the end.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'No,' he replied. 'This is only the beginning.'</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext3">Some days later there were strange stories in the newspapers, stories about young children who went out at night and did not go home until the next morning. And when they did go home, they talked about a 'beautiful lady'. All these children had drops of blood and two little wounds on their necks.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Van Helsing read these stories, and he brought the paper round to me. 'What do you think of that?' he asked.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'I don't know,' I said. 'These two little wounds sound like poor Lucy's wounds, but how can that be?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Then Van Helsing explained. At first I could not believe it, and we talked for a long time. At last I said, 'Are you saying that poor Lucy was killed by a vampire, and that now the vampire is taking blood from these children too?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'No,' Van Helsing replied. 'You haven't understood. The vampire which is taking blood from these children is ... Lucy herself.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I was very angry. 'That's not true!' I cried.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Then come with me,' he said. 'And I will show you.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">So that night he took me to Lucy's tomb. He had the key and we went inside. I was very afraid. In the dark, with the dead flowers lying on Lucy's coffin, the tomb was a terrible place. Slowly, Van Helsing began to open the coffin. Then he turned to me, and said, 'Look.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I came nearer and looked. The coffin was empty.</p>
<p class="normaltext">For me, it was a terrible surprise, but Van Helsing only shook his head. 'Now we must wait outside,' he said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">We waited all night. I was cold and afraid, and angry with myself and with Van Helsing. Then, suddenly, something white moved in the trees near the tomb. We went nearer, and we found a little child on the ground, by the tomb. Van Helsing held it out to me, and I looked at its neck. 'There are no wounds on the child's neck,' I said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'No,' Van Helsing replied. 'We are just in time.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">The next day, Van Helsing and I went back into the tomb again and opened the lid of the coffin. This time Lucy's body lay there. She died more than a week ago—but she did not look dead. Her mouth was red and her face was more beautiful than ever. Then Van Helsing pulled back her mouth and showed me her long, sharp teeth.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Now do you believe me?' he said. 'Lucy is now one of the Un-Dead, and with these teeth she will soon kill one of these poor little children. We must stop her before she does.' He stopped for a minute and thought. 'But we must send for Arthur. He, too, must see—and believe this.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Arthur was very unhappy, and also angry. He could not believe that Lucy was now one of the Un-Dead, but in the end he agreed to come with us to the tomb.</p>
<p class="normaltext">It was just before midnight when we got to the churchyard. The night was dark, but now and then, a little moonlight came through the clouds. Van Helsing opened the door of the tomb and we all went in.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Now, Jack,' he said to me, 'you were with me yesterday afternoon. Was Miss Lucy's body in that coffin then?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'It was,' I replied.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Slowly, Van Helsing opened the coffin. Arthur's face was white when he moved nearer. We all looked down. The coffin was empty!</p>
<p class="normaltext">For a minute, no one spoke. Then Van Helsing said, 'Now we must go outside and wait.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">It was good to be outside again, away from the dark, smelly tomb. We stood and waited in silence. Then, through the trees, we saw something white. It was moving nearer to us. Its face was white, its mouth was red, and drops of blood fell from it. Suddenly it saw us and stopped. It gave us a Look of terrible anger, and Arthur gave a little cry. 'It's Lucy!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">She smiled. 'Oh, Arthur, come to me. Leave those others, and come to me, my love,' she said sweetly.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Arthur took his hands from his face and opened his arms to her. She was moving nearer to him when Van Helsing ran between them, and held out his little gold cross. Lucy stopped and stood back from it. Then, with a look of terrible anger on her face, she went to the tomb and through the door. <span class="xt">The door was closed, but she went through it</span>!</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Now, Arthur, my friend,' Van Helsing said, 'do you understand?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Arthur put his face in his hands and cried, 'I do! Oh, I do!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">The next day, Arthur, Van Helsing, and I went back to the tomb. Van Helsing had a bag with him, and when we were in the tomb, he again opened Lucy's coffin. The body lay there, horribly beautiful. Arthur was white and he was shaking. 'Is this really Lucy?' he asked.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'It is, and it is not. But wait, and you will see the real Lucy again,' Van Helsing replied.</p>
<p class="normaltext">He took from his bag a long piece of wood and a hammer. Arthur and I stood silent and watched. Then Van Helsing said to Arthur, 'You loved Lucy. You must bring her back to us. You must take this piece of wood in your left hand, and the hammer in your right hand. Then you must drive the wood through Lucy's heart. It isn't easy for you, but it will soon be done. Can you do this for her?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'I can,' Arthur replied strongly.</p>
<p class="normaltext">His face was very pale, but he held the piece of wood over Lucy's heart. and brought the hammer down hard.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The body turned from side to side and a horrible scream came from the open red mouth. Arthur did not stop. Harder and harder he hit the wood with the hammer, until, at last, the body stopped moving and lay quiet.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The hammer fell from Arthur's hand, and he stood there, white and shaking. Van Helsing went over to him. 'And now you may kiss her,' he said. 'See! The vampire is dead, and the real Lucy has come back.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">It was true. Lucy's face was pale and still, but it was now quiet and restful. Arthur kissed her softly on the mouth, and then Van Helsing closed the coffin again, this time, for ever.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Now, my friends,' Van Helsing said, 'we have only just begun. We must find the vampire that killed Miss Lucy. It will be difficult and dangerous. Will you help me?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Yes,' we said. 'We will.'</p>

<p class="normaltext">The next morning at the hospital I had a note from Van Helsing. 'Watch Lucy carefully tonight,' he wrote. 'I shall be with you tomorrow.' But that was now today! The note was too late!</p>
<p class="normaltext">I did not wait for breakfast, but hurried to the house immediately. I knocked on the door, but there was no answer. Just then Van Helsing arrived.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'What happened?' he cried. 'Did you not get my note? Quick! Perhaps we are already too late!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">We knocked again, but there was still no answer. We went round to the back of the house and Van Helsing broke the kitchen window and we went in.</p>
<p class="normaltext">It was dark in the kitchen, but we could see the bodies of the four servants on the floor. They were not dead, but asleep. 'Someone put something in their drinks,' said Van Helsing. 'Come! We must find Lucy. If we are not too late!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">We ran up to Lucy's room, and stopped outside it. With white faces and shaking hands, we opened the door softly and went into the room.</p>
<p class="normaltext">How can I describe what we saw? The bodies of two women—Lucy and her mother—lay on the bed. The faces of both women were white, and on the mother's face there was a look of terrible fear. In her hand she held the flowers from Lucy's neck, and on the floor there was glass from the broken window.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Van Helsing looked down at the two women. 'The poor mother is dead,' he said. 'But for Lucy it is not too late! Go and wake the servants!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I ran downstairs to wake them. 'Put her in a hot bath,' Van Helsing said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">After a time, Lucy began to show some life, and they took her and put her in a warm bed. From time to time she slept, but she did not fight to stay alive. She could not eat anything, and she was very weak. We sent for Arthur, and when he came, he was very unhappy. His father was now dead, and he could see that Lucy was very, very ill. One of us sat with Lucy all the time, and that night Arthur and Van Helsing slept in the sitting-room, while I watched over Lucy.</p>
<p class="normaltext">When Van Helsing came back up to me at six o'clock, Arthur was still asleep downstairs. Van Helsing went over to Lucy and looked at her. 'The wounds on her neck have gone,' he said. 'She will soon be dead. Bring Arthur.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">When Arthur and I came back, Lucy opened her lovely eyes. 'Oh, Arthur,' she said softly. 'Kiss me, my love.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">He moved his head nearer to her, but Van Helsing pulled him back. 'No!' he cried. For a minute, Lucy's face was hard and angry. She opened her mouth, and her teeth looked very long and sharp. Then her eyes closed and she slept. Soon she woke again, took Van Helsing's hand and said softly, 'My true friend.' And then, quietly, Lucy died.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'She's gone,' said Van Helsing, and Arthur put his head in his hands and cried.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Later, I went back into Lucy's room, and Van Helsing and I looked down together at her beautiful face.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Poor girl,' I said. 'It is the end.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'No,' he replied. 'This is only the beginning.'</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext3">Some days later there were strange stories in the newspapers, stories about young children who went out at night and did not go home until the next morning. And when they did go home, they talked about a 'beautiful lady'. All these children had drops of blood and two little wounds on their necks.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Van Helsing read these stories, and he brought the paper round to me. 'What do you think of that?' he asked.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'I don't know,' I said. 'These two little wounds sound like poor Lucy's wounds, but how can that be?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Then Van Helsing explained. At first I could not believe it, and we talked for a long time. At last I said, 'Are you saying that poor Lucy was killed by a vampire, and that now the vampire is taking blood from these children too?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'No,' Van Helsing replied. 'You haven't understood. The vampire which is taking blood from these children is ... Lucy herself.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I was very angry. 'That's not true!' I cried.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Then come with me,' he said. 'And I will show you.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">So that night he took me to Lucy's tomb. He had the key and we went inside. I was very afraid. In the dark, with the dead flowers lying on Lucy's coffin, the tomb was a terrible place. Slowly, Van Helsing began to open the coffin. Then he turned to me, and said, 'Look.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I came nearer and looked. The coffin was empty.</p>
<p class="normaltext">For me, it was a terrible surprise, but Van Helsing only shook his head. 'Now we must wait outside,' he said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">We waited all night. I was cold and afraid, and angry with myself and with Van Helsing. Then, suddenly, something white moved in the trees near the tomb. We went nearer, and we found a little child on the ground, by the tomb. Van Helsing held it out to me, and I looked at its neck. 'There are no wounds on the child's neck,' I said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'No,' Van Helsing replied. 'We are just in time.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">The next day, Van Helsing and I went back into the tomb again and opened the lid of the coffin. This time Lucy's body lay there. She died more than a week ago—but she did not look dead. Her mouth was red and her face was more beautiful than ever. Then Van Helsing pulled back her mouth and showed me her long, sharp teeth.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Now do you believe me?' he said. 'Lucy is now one of the Un-Dead, and with these teeth she will soon kill one of these poor little children. We must stop her before she does.' He stopped for a minute and thought. 'But we must send for Arthur. He, too, must see—and believe this.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Arthur was very unhappy, and also angry. He could not believe that Lucy was now one of the Un-Dead, but in the end he agreed to come with us to the tomb.</p>
<p class="normaltext">It was just before midnight when we got to the churchyard. The night was dark, but now and then, a little moonlight came through the clouds. Van Helsing opened the door of the tomb and we all went in.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Now, Jack,' he said to me, 'you were with me yesterday afternoon. Was Miss Lucy's body in that coffin then?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'It was,' I replied.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Slowly, Van Helsing opened the coffin. Arthur's face was white when he moved nearer. We all looked down. The coffin was empty!</p>
<p class="normaltext">For a minute, no one spoke. Then Van Helsing said, 'Now we must go outside and wait.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">It was good to be outside again, away from the dark, smelly tomb. We stood and waited in silence. Then, through the trees, we saw something white. It was moving nearer to us. Its face was white, its mouth was red, and drops of blood fell from it. Suddenly it saw us and stopped. It gave us a Look of terrible anger, and Arthur gave a little cry. 'It's Lucy!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">She smiled. 'Oh, Arthur, come to me. Leave those others, and come to me, my love,' she said sweetly.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Arthur took his hands from his face and opened his arms to her. She was moving nearer to him when Van Helsing ran between them, and held out his little gold cross. Lucy stopped and stood back from it. Then, with a look of terrible anger on her face, she went to the tomb and through the door. <span class="xt">The door was closed, but she went through it</span>!</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Now, Arthur, my friend,' Van Helsing said, 'do you understand?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Arthur put his face in his hands and cried, 'I do! Oh, I do!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">The next day, Arthur, Van Helsing, and I went back to the tomb. Van Helsing had a bag with him, and when we were in the tomb, he again opened Lucy's coffin. The body lay there, horribly beautiful. Arthur was white and he was shaking. 'Is this really Lucy?' he asked.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'It is, and it is not. But wait, and you will see the real Lucy again,' Van Helsing replied.</p>
<p class="normaltext">He took from his bag a long piece of wood and a hammer. Arthur and I stood silent and watched. Then Van Helsing said to Arthur, 'You loved Lucy. You must bring her back to us. You must take this piece of wood in your left hand, and the hammer in your right hand. Then you must drive the wood through Lucy's heart. It isn't easy for you, but it will soon be done. Can you do this for her?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'I can,' Arthur replied strongly.</p>
<p class="normaltext">His face was very pale, but he held the piece of wood over Lucy's heart. and brought the hammer down hard.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The body turned from side to side and a horrible scream came from the open red mouth. Arthur did not stop. Harder and harder he hit the wood with the hammer, until, at last, the body stopped moving and lay quiet.</p>
<p class="normaltext">The hammer fell from Arthur's hand, and he stood there, white and shaking. Van Helsing went over to him. 'And now you may kiss her,' he said. 'See! The vampire is dead, and the real Lucy has come back.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">It was true. Lucy's face was pale and still, but it was now quiet and restful. Arthur kissed her softly on the mouth, and then Van Helsing closed the coffin again, this time, for ever.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Now, my friends,' Van Helsing said, 'we have only just begun. We must find the vampire that killed Miss Lucy. It will be difficult and dangerous. Will you help me?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Yes,' we said. 'We will.'</p>

            <h2 class="title2" id="mllj2">4．露西之死</h2>
<p class="picture"><img src="../../../Images/image07702.jpeg" alt="alt"/></p>
<p class="normaltext">露西得了一种怪病，当我从阿瑟那里得知这个可怕的消息时，立刻去了她那儿。可以看出，她病得很重。她整天躺在床上，一动不动。她的脸像鬼一样惨白，而且很瘦弱。夜晚来临时，她害怕去睡觉，早晨，她的脖子上就会出现两个奇怪的小伤口。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我不知道露西到底怎么了。她一直在失血。但血是怎么失掉的呢？是通过她脖子上的那两个小伤口吗？</p>
<p class="normaltext">我决定派人去请我以前的老师，在荷兰的范赫尔辛教授。也许他能帮上忙。</p>
<p class="normaltext">他立刻就赶来了，当他看了露西的病情后，说：“我们必须马上给她输血。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“她可以用我的血！”阿瑟大声说，“全部的血——直到最后一滴！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">范赫尔辛做得很对。有了阿瑟的血，露西马上开始好转了。但离开之前，范赫尔辛又做了一件事。他拿了一些味道很重的花，编成花环戴在露西的脖子上。“亲爱的，”他说，“这是大蒜花。今晚不要把它们从脖子上摘下来，也不要开窗户。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">范赫尔辛必须回荷兰几天，离开之前，他告诉我们：“你们必须每天晚上看着露西，确保她一直戴着大蒜花环。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">露西的母亲也病了——她心脏不好——阿瑟也不得不回家，因他父亲病危。所以有一周时间，晚上一直由我看护着露西，有时我坐在她床边，就会听到窗户那儿有奇怪的声响。我想也许是树，或者可能是风吧。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我白天在医院上班，一星期后，我已经很疲惫了，所以有一天晚上我没有去露西家，我需要睡一觉，而且我知道露西的母亲和仆人们都在那儿。而且范赫尔辛每天都会让人送来新的大蒜花，让露西在晚上戴着。</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天早晨，我在医院收到了范赫尔辛的一张便条。“今晚要小心看护露西，”他写道，“明天我会到你那儿去的。”但现在已经是今天了！这张便条来得太晚了！</p>
<p class="normaltext">我没等吃早饭就立刻赶往露西家。我敲了敲门，但没人应。正在这时范赫尔辛也赶到了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“出什么事了？”他大声说，“你没有收到我的便条吗？快点儿！也许我们已经太迟了！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们又敲门，但仍没有应答。我们就绕到屋子后面，范赫尔辛打破厨房的窗户，我们才爬了进去。</p>
<p class="normaltext">厨房里很暗，但我们可以看到地上四个仆人的躯体。他们没有死，只是睡着了。“有人在他们的饮料里放了东西。”范赫尔辛说，“快点儿！我们必须找到露西。希望还不是太晚！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们向楼上露西的房间跑去，在门外停了下来。我们脸色发白，双手发抖，轻轻地打开房门，走了进去。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我该怎么来描述眼前的情景？两个女人——露西和她妈妈——躺在床上。两人都面白如纸，而且母亲的脸上还有一种极度恐惧的表情。她的手里攥着从露西脖子上拿下来的花环，地上散落着窗户玻璃的碎片。</p>
<p class="normaltext">范赫尔辛俯身看了一下这两个女人。“可怜的妈妈已经死了，”他说，“但对于露西来说还不算太晚！去把那些仆人们叫醒！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我跑下楼把他们唤醒。“把她放到有热水的浴盆里。”范赫尔辛说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">过了一会儿，露西开始有了一点生气，仆人们把她放在温暖的床上。她时醒时睡，但并不挣扎着求生。她什么也不能吃，非常虚弱。我们让人去找阿瑟，他来的时候非常伤心。他父亲已经去世了，他能看出露西病得非常非常严重。我们中总有一个人时刻和露西待在一起，晚上阿瑟和范赫尔辛睡在客厅，我看护着露西。</p>
<p class="normaltext">6点钟，范赫尔辛回到我这儿时，阿瑟仍在楼下睡觉。范赫尔辛走过去看了看露西。“她脖子上的伤口没有了，”他说，“她快要死了。把阿瑟叫来。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我和阿瑟回来时，露西睁开了她迷人的眼睛。“哦，阿瑟，”她轻声说，“吻我，亲爱的。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">阿瑟把头靠近她，但范赫尔辛一把将他拉了回来。“别过去！”他大声说。有那么一瞬间，露西的脸变得又凶狠又愤怒。她张开了嘴，牙齿又长又尖。然后她闭上眼睛睡着了。很快她又醒了，拉住范赫尔辛的手，轻声说：“你是我真正的朋友。”然后露西就静静地死去了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“她走了。”范赫尔辛说道，阿瑟用手抱住头痛哭起来。</p>
<p class="normaltext">过了一会儿，我回到露西的房间，和范赫尔辛一起看着她美丽的脸。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“可怜的姑娘，”我说，“一切都结束了。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“不，”他回答说，“这仅仅是个开始。”</p>
<p class="normaltext"><br/></p>
<p class="normaltext">几天后报纸上报道了一些奇怪的事：一些小孩子夜里出去直到第二天早晨才回家。他们回到家时，总谈到一个“美丽的小姐”。他们的脖子上都有斑斑的血迹和两个小伤口。</p>
<p class="normaltext">范赫尔辛读了这些故事后，把报纸带到了我这儿。“你对此怎么想？”他问道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“我不知道，”我说，“这两个小伤口听起来很像可怜的露西的伤口，但怎么可能呢？”</p>
<p class="normaltext">然后范赫尔辛做了解释。起初我不相信，我们谈了很久。最后我说：“你是说可怜的露西被一个吸血鬼害死了，而现在这个吸血鬼又从这些孩子身上吸血？”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“不，”范赫尔辛回答说，“你没弄明白。从这些孩子身上吸血的这个吸血鬼正是……露西本人。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我很生气。“不可能！”我叫道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“那么跟我来，”他说，“我要让你看看。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">于是那天晚上他把我带到了露西的墓地。他有钥匙，我们进到了里面。我非常害怕。四周一片黑暗，露西棺材上的花都已枯死，墓室显得非常恐怖。范赫尔辛慢慢地打开棺材，然后他转向我说：“看。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我走近一看，棺材是空的。</p>
<p class="normaltext">对于我来说，这真是一件可怕的怪事，但范赫尔辛只是摇了摇头，“现在我们必须在外面等着。”他说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们在那里等了一夜。我又冷又怕，既恨自己，又怨范赫尔辛。突然，有一团白色的东西进了墓地附近的树林。我们走近一些，发现地上躺着一个小孩儿，就躺在墓穴旁边。范赫尔辛把孩子抱起来递给我，我看了一下孩子的脖子。“孩子的脖子上没有伤口。”我说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“不，”范赫尔辛回答道，“我们来的正是时候。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天我和范赫尔辛又来到了墓地，掀开棺材的盖子。这次露西的尸体躺在里面。她是一个多星期前死的——但她看起来根本不像死人。她的嘴红红的，脸前所未有地漂亮。然后范赫尔辛扒开她的嘴，让我看她那又长又尖的牙齿。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“这下你相信我了吗？”他说，“露西现在就是一个吸血鬼，她很快就会用这些牙齿害死其中一个可怜的小孩子。我们必须在她杀人之前制止她。”他停下来想了想，“但我们得让人去找阿瑟。他也必须看到——并且相信这件事。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">阿瑟很不高兴，也很愤怒。他不相信露西现在会是一个吸血鬼，但最后他还是答应和我们一块儿去墓地。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们刚好在午夜之前到达了教堂墓地。夜色漆黑，但是云层间偶尔透出些月光。范赫尔辛打开墓室的门，我们走了进去。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“嘿，杰克，”他对我说，“昨天下午你和我一起来时，露西小姐的尸体在棺材里吗？”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“是的。”我回答说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">范赫尔辛慢慢地打开棺材。阿瑟走近时，脸变得煞白。我们都朝里望去。棺材是空的！</p>
<p class="normaltext">一时间，我们都默默无言。过了一会儿，范赫尔辛说：“我们必须去外面等着。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">离开这座阴暗难闻的墓室重新回到外面，感觉好多了。我们静静地站在那儿等着。就在那时，我们看到树林里有一个白影正向我们走来。它越走越近，脸色惨白，嘴唇血红，而鲜血又不时地从嘴里滴下来。突然它看见我们，停了下来，恼怒地盯着我们，神色可怕。阿瑟低声叫道：“是露西！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">她笑了。“哦，阿瑟，到我这儿来。亲爱的，离开那些人，到我这儿来。”她温柔地说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">阿瑟把捂着脸的手放了下来，他张开双臂，向她走去。她也慢慢地向他靠近，这时范赫尔辛跑到他们中间，拿出他的小金十字架。露西站住了，退回去想避开它。然后她带着一脸的愤怒，穿过门走进墓室。<span class="xx">门是关着的</span>，<span class="xx">而她却穿了过去</span>！</p>
<p class="normaltext">“现在，阿瑟，我的朋友，”范赫尔辛说，“你相信了吧？”</p>
<p class="normaltext">阿瑟抱着头哭道：“我相信了！哦，我相信了！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天，阿瑟、范赫尔辛和我回到墓室。范赫尔辛拿着一个口袋，我们走进墓室，他又打开了露西的棺材。尸体躺在那儿，美得吓人。阿瑟脸色苍白，浑身发抖。“这真的是露西吗？”他问道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“是的，但也不是。不过等一会儿你就会看到真正的露西了。”范赫尔辛回答道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">他从袋子里掏出一根长长的木条和一把锤子。我和阿瑟静静地站在那儿，看着他。范赫尔辛对阿瑟说：“你曾经爱过露西。你必须把她给我们带回来。你必须左手拿着这块木头，右手拿着锤子，然后把木头钉进露西的心脏。这对你来说很不容易，但很快就会做完的。你能为她做这件事吗？</p>
<p class="normaltext">“我能。”阿瑟坚定地回答。</p>
<p class="normaltext">他脸色苍白，但还是把木头放在露西的心脏上，用锤子猛地砸了下去。</p>
<p class="normaltext">尸体翻滚着，张着血红的嘴，发出凄厉的惨叫，但阿瑟没有停下来。他越来越猛烈地用铁锤敲击着木头，直到最后，尸体不动了，静静地躺在那里。</p>
<p class="normaltext">铁锤从阿瑟的手中滑落下来。他站在那儿，脸色苍白，浑身发抖。范赫尔辛走到他身边。“现在你可以吻她了，”他说，“看！吸血鬼死了，真正的露西回来了。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">确实如此。露西苍白而僵硬的脸，现在显得宁静而安祥。阿瑟在她的嘴上轻轻吻了一下，范赫尔辛重新盖上了棺材，这次是永远地盖上了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“我的朋友们，”范赫尔辛说，“现在我们只是刚刚开始。我们必须找到害死露西小姐的那个吸血鬼。这既艰难又危险。你们愿意帮助我吗？”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“是的，”我们说，“我们愿意。”</p>

            <h1 class="title1">JONATHAN HARKER'S DIARY<br/>乔纳森·哈克的日记</h1>
<h2 class="title2" id="mllj1"><span class="underline">5</span><br/>Mina in danger</h2>
<p class="normaltext">Some days after Mina got the Letter from Arthur, with the news of Lucy's death, she had another letter. This was from Professor Van Helsing, a friend of Arthur's. In it he wrote, 'I know, from your letters to Lucy, that you were her dearest friend. I would very much like to meet you, to talk about the time when you were with Lucy at Whitby.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">So the Professor came to see us at our house, and we learnt the full story of poor Lucy's terrible death. Then Mina gave Van Helsing my diary to read, and he learnt about my time at Castle Dracula. He was very excited.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Ah!' he cried. 'Now I begin to understand so many things! This Count Dracula—he was the vampire that killed poor Miss Lucy. Will you help us to find him?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Of course, Mina and I agreed to help. When I saw Count Dracula in London, I was very afraid, but now I felt stronger because I had work to do.</p>
<p class="normaltext">We began at once. Mina went to stay with Jack Seward at his house, to tell him and Arthur all about the Count, and I went to Whitby. I wanted to find out about the coffins that were in the ship on the night of the storm—the ship that brought Count Dracula to England. After many questions, I learnt that the coffins were now in the Count's house in London.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I hurried back to London and to Jack Seward's house. When I told Van Helsing this news, he called us all together, and said, 'Now the danger begins. I have learnt much about vampires from old books, and I know that they can come out only at night. During the day they are like dead bodies and must have a place to hide. I think that Count Dracula uses his coffins for his daytime hiding places. If we can find him in a coffin. we can kill him. But let's go to his house tonight. We'll put holy bread in the coffins, and then the Count cannot get back into them. He'll then have no place to hide during the day, and he will be weaker, and easier to fight when we find him.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">So that night Van Helsing, Jack, Arthur, and I went out together to the Count's house. Mina, of course, did not come with us. I was afraid to leave her alone, but she said that there was more danger for us than for her.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Jack had some old keys with him, and with one of these we got into the house. It was old and dirty, and the smell of blood was everywhere. We walked through the cold, empty rooms and at last we found the coffins.</p>
<p class="normaltext">From his bag Van Helsing took some holy bread. 'We must put a piece of this in each coffin,' he said.</p>
<p class="normaltext">We worked hard. It took a long time to break open each coffin and put holy bread inside. We were just opening the last coffin when Van Helsing gave a cry. 'We are too late! The Count is coming!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">We looked up from our work and saw Count Dracula. He came through the dark room like a black cloud. His angry face was white and his eyes burned like red fires. Van Helsing held out his gold cross, and the Count stopped. Afraid for our lives, we ran from the house.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Quick!' cried Van Helsing. 'We must get back! Now he has seen us, Mina may be in danger!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">My heart nearly stopped when I heard this. 'Oh, Mina!' I cried silently. 'I cannot lose Mina!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">But when we got back to Jack's house, everything was quiet. I ran upstairs. The bedroom door was locked. I called out to my friends. 'Help me! Oh, help me!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Together we broke down the door—and then my blood ran cold. A tall dark man was standing in the moonlight, by the window. In his arms he held my wife, my Mina! Her white nightdress had blood on it, and her face lay against Count Dracula. Blood dropped from his mouth, and he was holding Mina to him <span class="xt">while she drank his blood</span>!</p>
<p class="normaltext">I ran to her and tried to pull him away from her. Van Helsing ran at the Count and held up his gold cross.</p>
<p class="normaltext">When he saw the cross, Count Dracula moved back and dropped Mina's body. She gave a terrible cry and fell across the bed. A cloud moved across the moon, and when the moon came from behind it, Count Dracula was not there.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Oh, Mina, my love!' I cried. I took her in my arms. 'What has happened? Tell us!' I was wild with fear.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Mina shivered. 'Don't leave me!' she cried. 'Oh, please don't leave me!' Her face was pale, and we could see two little wounds on her neck. She put her head in her hands and gave a long, terrible scream. 'Stay with me!' she cried.</p>
<p class="normaltext">And I held her in my arms until the first light of day showed in the east.</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj1"><span class="underline">5</span><br/>Mina in danger</h2>
<p class="normaltext">Some days after Mina got the Letter from Arthur, with the news of Lucy's death, she had another letter. This was from Professor Van Helsing, a friend of Arthur's. In it he wrote, 'I know, from your letters to Lucy, that you were her dearest friend. I would very much like to meet you, to talk about the time when you were with Lucy at Whitby.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">So the Professor came to see us at our house, and we learnt the full story of poor Lucy's terrible death. Then Mina gave Van Helsing my diary to read, and he learnt about my time at Castle Dracula. He was very excited.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Ah!' he cried. 'Now I begin to understand so many things! This Count Dracula—he was the vampire that killed poor Miss Lucy. Will you help us to find him?'</p>
<p class="normaltext">Of course, Mina and I agreed to help. When I saw Count Dracula in London, I was very afraid, but now I felt stronger because I had work to do.</p>
<p class="normaltext">We began at once. Mina went to stay with Jack Seward at his house, to tell him and Arthur all about the Count, and I went to Whitby. I wanted to find out about the coffins that were in the ship on the night of the storm—the ship that brought Count Dracula to England. After many questions, I learnt that the coffins were now in the Count's house in London.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I hurried back to London and to Jack Seward's house. When I told Van Helsing this news, he called us all together, and said, 'Now the danger begins. I have learnt much about vampires from old books, and I know that they can come out only at night. During the day they are like dead bodies and must have a place to hide.

            <h2 class="title2" id="mllj1">5．明娜身处险境</h2>
<p class="normaltext">明娜收到阿瑟的信，得知露西去世的消息几天后，她又收到一封信。这是阿瑟的一个朋友，范赫尔辛教授写来的。他在信中写道：“我从你给露西的信中得知，你是她最亲密的朋友。我非常想见见你，谈一谈你和露西在惠特比时的情况。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">后来，教授到家中来看我们，我们也由此知道了可怜的露西去世的全部可怕的经过。明娜给范赫尔辛看了我的日记，他知道了我在德拉库拉城堡的经历。他很激动。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“啊！”他大声说道，“现在我开始弄明白很多事了！这个德拉库拉伯爵——他就是害死可怜的露西小姐的那个吸血鬼。你们愿意帮我们找到他吗？”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我和明娜当然同意帮忙。在伦敦见到德拉库拉伯爵时，我很害怕，但现在因为有正经事要做，我感觉坚强多了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们马上开始行动。明娜去住在杰克·苏厄德的家，告诉他和阿瑟关于伯爵的一切情况，而我去了惠特比。我想了解在暴风雨的那天晚上，船上那些棺材的去向——就是那艘把伯爵带到英国的船。经多方打听，我得知那些棺材就在伯爵在伦敦的家里。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我匆匆赶回伦敦，又去，杰克·苏厄德的家。当我把这个消息告诉范赫尔辛时，他把我们召集到一起说：“现在危险降临了。我从古书上了解到吸血鬼的不少情况，我知道他们只能在晚上出来，白天他们就像死尸一样，而且必须找个地方躲起来。我想德拉库拉伯爵就是把那些棺材当作了他白天的藏身之地。如果我们能在棺材里找到他，就可以杀死他。但今晚咱们到他的住所去一趟，在那些棺材里放上圣餐饼，这样伯爵就不能再回到那里面去了。他白天就没有了藏身之处，会变得越来越虚弱，那么我们在找到他时，打败他也会容易些。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">那天晚上，我、范赫尔辛、杰克·苏厄德和阿瑟一起去了伯爵的住宅。当然明娜没和我们一起去。把她独自留在那儿我很害怕，但她说我们要比她危险得多。</p>
<p class="normaltext">杰克·苏厄德带了几把旧钥匙，我们用其中一把打开门，进入那房子。那里又旧又脏，而且到处弥漫着血腥味儿。我们穿过很多阴森森的空屋子，终于找到了那些棺材。</p>
<p class="normaltext">范赫尔辛从他的袋子掏出一些圣餐饼。“我们必须在每具棺材里放一块。”他说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们的工作很费力。要用很长时间才能打开一副棺材，把圣餐饼放进去。当我们正要打开最后一个棺材时，范赫尔辛叫了一声：“我们太迟了！伯爵回来了！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们停下工作，抬起头来，看见了德拉库拉伯爵。他像一片乌云一样穿过黑暗的房间。他一脸怒容，面色惨白，眼睛像两团燃烧着的红色火焰。范赫尔辛举起了他的金十字架，伯爵停住了。我们害怕有生命危险，就迅速离开了那座房子。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“快点！”范赫尔辛喊道，“我们必须回去！现在他已经看见我们了，明娜可能有危险！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">听到这话，我的心脏几乎停止了跳动。“哦，明娜！”我心里喊着，“我不能失去明娜！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">但当我们回到杰克的家时，四处一片寂静。我跑上楼梯，卧室的门锁上了。我对着朋友们大喊：“帮帮我！哦，帮我一把！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们一起把门撞倒——然后我的血一下子变冷了。一个高大的黑衣男人站在窗前的月光下。他怀里抱着我的妻子，我的明娜！她白色的睡衣上有血迹，她的脸靠着德拉库拉伯爵。血从他的嘴里滴下来，他正把明娜拉向他，<span class="xx">而她在喝他的血</span>！</p>
<p class="normaltext">我奔向她，试图把他从她身边拖开。范赫尔辛跑到伯爵面前，举起了他的金十字架。</p>
<p class="normaltext">看到十字架时，德拉库拉伯爵丢下了明娜，向后退去。她发出了一声令人恐惧的尖叫，横倒在床上。一片乌云遮住了月光，当月亮从云中钻出来时，德拉库拉伯爵已经不见了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“哦，明娜，我亲爱的！”我叫着，把她抱在怀里，“怎么了？告诉我们！”我害怕得要发疯了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">明娜颤栗着。“不要离开我！”她哭喊着，“哦，请不要离开我！”她脸色苍白，我们可以看见她脖子上有两个小伤口。她双手抱头，发出一声长长的恐怖的尖叫。“不要离开我！”她大叫着。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我一直把她抱在怀里，直到东方出现第一缕曙光。</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj2"><span class="underline">6</span><br/>Dracula must die</h2>
<p class="normaltext">The next day Van Helsing, Jack Seward, Arthur, and I made our plans. Mina was there too. She was very pale, but she wanted to help us. We knew that we had to kill Dracula before Mina died.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'If we don't,' Van Helsing said, 'Mina will die and will be a vampire for ever. I have been back to the Count's house this morning, and the last coffin has gone. We must find it. Count Dracula will be in it during the day. If we can find him before dark, we can kill him.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'But where is it now?' I asked wildly.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Of course, we did not know the answer. But then Mina spoke. 'I feel that I am half a vampire already, and sometimes strange thoughts come into my head. I think that these thoughts are Count Dracula's. Just now, when you were speaking, I thought that I could hear the sound of a ship moving through water.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Of course!' cried Van Helsing. 'Dracula has decided to leave England! He knows now that we are his enemies and that it is dangerous for him here. So he is going back to Transylvania—by ship! We must find out which ships left for the Black Sea last night.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">At the London shipping office we learnt that one ship sailed for Varna in the Black Sea the night before. We also learnt of a passenger who arrived at the last minute—a tall thin man in black. He had a pale face, burning eyes, and a very red mouth. And he had with him a long box!</p>
<p class="normaltext">'So,' said Van Helsing. 'The ship will take about three weeks to sail to Varna, but we will take the train across Europe and get there much faster. We leave tomorrow!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">We left London on a cold October day and four days later we were in Varna. We made our plans, and waited for the ship to arrive. Every day Mina told us that she could still hear the sound of water. But three weeks went by, and the ship did not arrive. Then, at last, we had news—the ship was not coming to Varna, and was already at Galatz!</p>
<p class="normaltext">We took the first train to Galatz, but we were too late. The box was no longer on the ship. 'Someone came and took it this morning,' one of the sailors told us.</p>
<p class="normaltext">We hurried back to our hotel to tell my dear Mina the news, but we saw that she knew it already, and her face was white with fear. 'He has gone,' she said quietly, 'and he is taking me with him. Oh my dear friends! Before I change into a vampire, you must kill me! Then you must do what you did to poor Lucy, to give me rest. Tell me that you will do this for me!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I held her hands, but I could not speak. If that day ever comes, I don't know how I shall live through it.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Later, while Mina slept, we tried to make new plans.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'She is right,' said Van Helsing unhappily. 'Our poor Mina is in great danger. She is already beginning to change—her teeth are getting longer and sharper, and when the Count reads her thoughts, her eyes are hard and cold. We must find him and kill him—before it is too late!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I can remember little of the next few days. I was wild with fear and anger. We learnt that the Count's coffin was travelling by boat up the river, and Jack Seward, Arthur, and I began to follow in another boat. Van Helsing took my Mina with him in a carriage, and they began to drive across the mountains to Castle Dracula. When I said goodbye to her, my heart was breaking. Perhaps I shall never see her again.</p>
<p class="normaltext">We followed the Count's boat for five days, but we could not catch it. Then we learnt from some villagers that he was now travelling by road, so we bought horses and rode like the wind through the night.</p>
<p class="normaltext">By late afternoon on the next day, we were getting near to Castle Dracula. 'We must ride faster!' I cried to the others. The sun was beginning to go down and then, suddenly, we saw on the road in front of us some men with a cart. And on the back of the cart was the coffin.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I had only one thought in my head—to kill the vampire, to finish him for ever. Arthur and Jack were right behind me when I got to the cart. I jumped from my horse onto the cart, and while Jack and Arthur fought the driver and the other men, I pushed the coffin to the ground. It fell and broke open. Count Dracula lay there, and the last light from the sun fell on his terrible face. His eyes burned red and they looked at me in hate. In a few seconds, when the sun went down, he would be free to move. I jumped down to the ground, held my knife high over his heart, and brought it down as hard as I could. It went straight through the vampire's heart. Count Dracula gave a horrible scream, and then lay quiet. In the same second the sun went down, and when we looked into the coffin again, it was empty...</p>
<p class="normaltext">Above us on the hill was Castle Dracula, and soon we saw Van Helsing. He hurried down the hill to us, and my dear Mina was with him. I ran to her and took her in my arms. Her lovely face was bright and happy again. 'It's all right, my love,' she said softly. 'We found the tombs of the three vampire women. They cannot hurt us now, and Dracula is dead at last! We can begin to live again.'</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj3">6．德拉库拉必须死</h2>
<p class="normaltext">第二天，我和范赫尔辛、杰克·苏厄德、阿瑟一起制定了计划。明娜也在。她非常苍白，但也想帮助我们。我们知道必须在明娜死去之前除掉德拉库拉。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“如果我们不杀掉他，”范赫尔辛说，“明娜就会死，而且将永远成为一个吸血鬼。我今天早晨又去了伯爵的家，最后一副棺材不见了。我们必须找到它。白天德拉库拉伯爵一定会待在里面。如果能在天黑之前找到他，我们就能杀死他。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“但现在它在哪呢？”我近乎疯狂地问道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们当然不知道答案。但这时明娜说话了。“我感觉自己已经是半个吸血鬼了，有时一些奇怪的想法会侵入我的脑子。我想这些想法是来自德拉库拉伯爵的。刚才，你们说话时，我好像听到了船在水里行进的声音。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“当然了，”范赫尔辛叫道，“德拉库拉已决定离开英国！他知道我们现在都与他为敌，他在这儿很不安全。所以他现在正返回特兰西瓦尼亚——肯定是乘船！我们必须弄清楚昨天晚上是哪一艘船离开此地开往黑海的。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">在伦敦海运事物所，我们得知前一天晚上有一艘船开往黑海的瓦尔纳。我们还听说有一位乘客在最后一刻才到——一个身穿黑色衣服，又高又瘦的男人。他脸色惨白，两眼通红，长着一张血红的嘴。他还带着一个很长的箱子！</p>
<p class="normaltext">“那么，”范赫尔辛说道，“这只船要用大约三个星期才能到瓦尔纳，但我们可以乘火车横跨欧洲大陆更快地到达那里。我们明天出发！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">在十月一个寒冷的日子，我们离开了伦敦，四天后到达了瓦尔纳。我们作了周密的安排，只等轮船到达。每天明娜都会告诉我们，她依然可以听到流水的声音。但三个星期过去了，船还是没到。最后，消息传来——船已到达加拉茨，不来瓦尔纳了！</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们坐第一班火车去了加拉茨，但还是太晚了。箱子已不在船上。“今天早晨有人来把它取走了。”一个水手告诉我们。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们又匆忙赶回旅馆，把这个消息告诉了我亲爱的明娜，但显然她已经知道了。她的脸吓得发白。“他走了，”她平静地说，“也把我带走了。哦，我亲爱的朋友们！在我变成一个吸血鬼之前，你们一定要杀了我！你们一定要像对待可怜的露西那样来处置我，让我安息。答应我你们会为我那样做的！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我握着她的手，一句话也说不出来。如果那一天真的来了，我不知道自己该怎样熬过去。</p>
<p class="normaltext">后来，明娜睡着了，我们又做了新的打算。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“她说对了，”范赫尔辛忧郁地说，“我们可怜的明娜情况十分危急。她已经开始变了——她的牙齿越来越长，越来越尖，当伯爵侵入她的思想时，她的眼神就变得僵直而冷酷。我们必须找到并杀掉他——趁一切还不算太晚！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">以后几天的事情我几乎什么都记不得了。我既害怕又愤怒，几乎要发疯了。当得知伯爵的棺材已用船运往河的上游后，我和杰克·苏厄德还有阿瑟开始乘另一艘船追去。范赫尔辛则带着我的明娜乘坐马车，要翻过山去德拉库拉城堡。和她告别时，我的心都碎了。也许我永远也不会再见到她了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们跟着伯爵的船走了五天，但还是没有赶上。后来一些村民告诉我们，他们现在走陆路，于是我们就买了马，像风一样在黑夜里狂奔。</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天黄昏时，我们已接近德托库拉城堡了。“我们必须加快速度！”我对他们两人喊到。太阳已开始西沉，突然我看见前面路上有一些人赶着马车，而马车后面装的就是那副棺材。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我的脑子里只有一个念头——杀掉那个吸血鬼，让他永远消失。我追上马车时，杰克和阿瑟紧随着我。我从马上跳到了马车上，杰克和阿瑟则和车夫及其他人搏斗，我把棺材推到地上。棺材落下来，裂开了。德托库拉伯爵就躺在那儿，太阳的最后一束光线照在他可怕的脸上。他的眼睛里燃烧着仇恨的火焰，直直地盯着我。再过几秒钟，当太阳落山时，他就可以自由活动了。我跳到地上，高高地举起了手中的匕首，用尽全力刺向他的心脏。匕首直穿入那吸血鬼的心脏。德拉库拉伯爵发出一声凄厉的惨叫，然后就一动不动了。就在同时，太阳落了下去，我们再朝棺材里看时，里面已经空了……</p>
<p class="normaltext">山上就是德拉库拉城堡，我们很快就见到了范赫尔辛。他正匆匆地下山来找我们，我的明娜也和他在一起。我跑过去把她抱在了怀里。她可爱的脸上又充满了快乐和幸福。“好了，我亲爱的，”她轻轻地说，“我们找到了那三个女吸血鬼的墓地，她们现在已无法伤害我们了，德拉库拉也终于被除掉了！我们又可以开始新的生活了。”</p>

<p class="normaltext">明娜收到阿瑟的信，得知露西去世的消息几天后，她又收到一封信。这是阿瑟的一个朋友，范赫尔辛教授写来的。他在信中写道：“我从你给露西的信中得知，你是她最亲密的朋友。我非常想见见你，谈一谈你和露西在惠特比时的情况。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">后来，教授到家中来看我们，我们也由此知道了可怜的露西去世的全部可怕的经过。明娜给范赫尔辛看了我的日记，他知道了我在德拉库拉城堡的经历。他很激动。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“啊！”他大声说道，“现在我开始弄明白很多事了！这个德拉库拉伯爵——他就是害死可怜的露西小姐的那个吸血鬼。你们愿意帮我们找到他吗？”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我和明娜当然同意帮忙。在伦敦见到德拉库拉伯爵时，我很害怕，但现在因为有正经事要做，我感觉坚强多了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们马上开始行动。明娜去住在杰克·苏厄德的家，告诉他和阿瑟关于伯爵的一切情况，而我去了惠特比。我想了解在暴风雨的那天晚上，船上那些棺材的去向——就是那艘把伯爵带到英国的船。经多方打听，我得知那些棺材就在伯爵在伦敦的家里。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我匆匆赶回伦敦，又去，杰克·苏厄德的家。当我把这个消息告诉范赫尔辛时，他把我们召集到一起说：“现在危险降临了。我从古书上了解到吸血鬼的不少情况，我知道他们只能在晚上出来，白天他们就像死尸一样，而且必须找个地方躲起来。我想德拉库拉伯爵就是把那些棺材当作了他白天的藏身之地。如果我们能在棺材里找到他，就可以杀死他。但今晚咱们到他的住所去一趟，在那些棺材里放上圣餐饼，这样伯爵就不能再回到那里面去了。他白天就没有了藏身之处，会变得越来越虚弱，那么我们在找到他时，打败他也会容易些。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">那天晚上，我、范赫尔辛、杰克·苏厄德和阿瑟一起去了伯爵的住宅。当然明娜没和我们一起去。把她独自留在那儿我很害怕，但她说我们要比她危险得多。</p>
<p class="normaltext">杰克·苏厄德带了几把旧钥匙，我们用其中一把打开门，进入那房子。那里又旧又脏，而且到处弥漫着血腥味儿。我们穿过很多阴森森的空屋子，终于找到了那些棺材。</p>
<p class="normaltext">范赫尔辛从他的袋子掏出一些圣餐饼。“我们必须在每具棺材里放一块。”他说。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们的工作很费力。要用很长时间才能打开一副棺材，把圣餐饼放进去。当我们正要打开最后一个棺材时，范赫尔辛叫了一声：“我们太迟了！伯爵回来了！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们停下工作，抬起头来，看见了德拉库拉伯爵。他像一片乌云一样穿过黑暗的房间。他一脸怒容，面色惨白，眼睛像两团燃烧着的红色火焰。范赫尔辛举起了他的金十字架，伯爵停住了。我们害怕有生命危险，就迅速离开了那座房子。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“快点！”范赫尔辛喊道，“我们必须回去！现在他已经看见我们了，明娜可能有危险！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">听到这话，我的心脏几乎停止了跳动。“哦，明娜！”我心里喊着，“我不能失去明娜！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">但当我们回到杰克的家时，四处一片寂静。我跑上楼梯，卧室的门锁上了。我对着朋友们大喊：“帮帮我！哦，帮我一把！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们一起把门撞倒——然后我的血一下子变冷了。一个高大的黑衣男人站在窗前的月光下。他怀里抱着我的妻子，我的明娜！她白色的睡衣上有血迹，她的脸靠着德拉库拉伯爵。血从他的嘴里滴下来，他正把明娜拉向他，<span class="xx">而她在喝他的血</span>！</p>
<p class="normaltext">我奔向她，试图把他从她身边拖开。范赫尔辛跑到伯爵面前，举起了他的金十字架。</p>
<p class="normaltext">看到十字架时，德拉库拉伯爵丢下了明娜，向后退去。她发出了一声令人恐惧的尖叫，横倒在床上。一片乌云遮住了月光，当月亮从云中钻出来时，德拉库拉伯爵已经不见了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“哦，明娜，我亲爱的！”我叫着，把她抱在怀里，“怎么了？告诉我们！”我害怕得要发疯了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">明娜颤栗着。“不要离开我！”她哭喊着，“哦，请不要离开我！”她脸色苍白，我们可以看见她脖子上有两个小伤口。她双手抱头，发出一声长长的恐怖的尖叫。“不要离开我！”她大叫着。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我一直把她抱在怀里，直到东方出现第一缕曙光。</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj2"><span class="underline">6</span><br/>Dracula must die</h2>
<p class="normaltext">The next day Van Helsing, Jack Seward, Arthur, and I made our plans. Mina was there too. She was very pale, but she wanted to help us. We knew that we had to kill Dracula before Mina died.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'If we don't,' Van Helsing said, 'Mina will die and will be a vampire for ever. I have been back to the Count's house this morning, and the last coffin has gone. We must find it. Count Dracula will be in it during the day. If we can find him before dark, we can kill him.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'But where is it now?' I asked wildly.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Of course, we did not know the answer. But then Mina spoke. 'I feel that I am half a vampire already, and sometimes strange thoughts come into my head. I think that these thoughts are Count Dracula's. Just now, when you were speaking, I thought that I could hear the sound of a ship moving through water.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">'Of course!' cried Van Helsing. 'Dracula has decided to leave England! He knows now that we are his enemies and that it is dangerous for him here. So he is going back to Transylvania—by ship! We must find out which ships left for the Black Sea last night.'</p>
<p class="normaltext">At the London shipping office we learnt that one ship sailed for Varna in the Black Sea the night before. We also learnt of a passenger who arrived at the last minute—a tall thin man in black. He had a pale face, burning eyes, and a very red mouth. And he had with him a long box!</p>
<p class="normaltext">'So,' said Van Helsing. 'The ship will take about three weeks to sail to Varna, but we will take the train across Europe and get there much faster. We leave tomorrow!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">We left London on a cold October day and four days later we were in Varna. We made our plans, and waited for the ship to arrive. Every day Mina told us that she could still hear the sound of water. But three weeks went by, and the ship did not arrive. Then, at last, we had news—the ship was not coming to Varna, and was already at Galatz!</p>
<p class="normaltext">We took the first train to Galatz, but we were too late. The box was no longer on the ship. 'Someone came and took it this morning,' one of the sailors told us.</p>
<p class="normaltext">We hurried back to our hotel to tell my dear Mina the news, but we saw that she knew it already, and her face was white with fear. 'He has gone,' she said quietly, 'and he is taking me with him. Oh my dear friends! Before I change into a vampire, you must kill me! Then you must do what you did to poor Lucy, to give me rest. Tell me that you will do this for me!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I held her hands, but I could not speak. If that day ever comes, I don't know how I shall live through it.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Later, while Mina slept, we tried to make new plans.</p>
<p class="normaltext">'She is right,' said Van Helsing unhappily. 'Our poor Mina is in great danger. She is already beginning to change—her teeth are getting longer and sharper, and when the Count reads her thoughts, her eyes are hard and cold. We must find him and kill him—before it is too late!'</p>
<p class="normaltext">I can remember little of the next few days. I was wild with fear and anger. We learnt that the Count's coffin was travelling by boat up the river, and Jack Seward, Arthur, and I began to follow in another boat. Van Helsing took my Mina with him in a carriage, and they began to drive across the mountains to Castle Dracula. When I said goodbye to her, my heart was breaking. Perhaps I shall never see her again.</p>
<p class="normaltext">We followed the Count's boat for five days, but we could not catch it. Then we learnt from some villagers that he was now travelling by road, so we bought horses and rode like the wind through the night.</p>
<p class="normaltext">By late afternoon on the next day, we were getting near to Castle Dracula. 'We must ride faster!' I cried to the others. The sun was beginning to go down and then, suddenly, we saw on the road in front of us some men with a cart. And on the back of the cart was the coffin.</p>
<p class="normaltext">I had only one thought in my head—to kill the vampire, to finish him for ever. Arthur and Jack were right behind me when I got to the cart. I jumped from my horse onto the cart, and while Jack and Arthur fought the driver and the other men, I pushed the coffin to the ground. It fell and broke open. Count Dracula lay there, and the last light from the sun fell on his terrible face. His eyes burned red and they looked at me in hate. In a few seconds, when the sun went down, he would be free to move. I jumped down to the ground, held my knife high over his heart, and brought it down as hard as I could. It went straight through the vampire's heart. Count Dracula gave a horrible scream, and then lay quiet. In the same second the sun went down, and when we looked into the coffin again, it was empty...</p>
<p class="normaltext">Above us on the hill was Castle Dracula, and soon we saw Van Helsing. He hurried down the hill to us, and my dear Mina was with him. I ran to her and took her in my arms. Her lovely face was bright and happy again. 'It's all right, my love,' she said softly. 'We found the tombs of the three vampire women. They cannot hurt us now, and Dracula is dead at last! We can begin to live again.'</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj3">6．德拉库拉必须死</h2>
<p class="normaltext">第二天，我和范赫尔辛、杰克·苏厄德、阿瑟一起制定了计划。明娜也在。她非常苍白，但也想帮助我们。我们知道必须在明娜死去之前除掉德拉库拉。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“如果我们不杀掉他，”范赫尔辛说，“明娜就会死，而且将永远成为一个吸血鬼。我今天早晨又去了伯爵的家，最后一副棺材不见了。我们必须找到它。白天德拉库拉伯爵一定会待在里面。如果能在天黑之前找到他，我们就能杀死他。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“但现在它在哪呢？”我近乎疯狂地问道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们当然不知道答案。但这时明娜说话了。“我感觉自己已经是半个吸血鬼了，有时一些奇怪的想法会侵入我的脑子。我想这些想法是来自德拉库拉伯爵的。刚才，你们说话时，我好像听到了船在水里行进的声音。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“当然了，”范赫尔辛叫道，“德拉库拉已决定离开英国！他知道我们现在都与他为敌，他在这儿很不安全。所以他现在正返回特兰西瓦尼亚——肯定是乘船！我们必须弄清楚昨天晚上是哪一艘船离开此地开往黑海的。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">在伦敦海运事物所，我们得知前一天晚上有一艘船开往黑海的瓦尔纳。我们还听说有一位乘客在最后一刻才到——一个身穿黑色衣服，又高又瘦的男人。他脸色惨白，两眼通红，长着一张血红的嘴。他还带着一个很长的箱子！</p>
<p class="normaltext">“那么，”范赫尔辛说道，“这只船要用大约三个星期才能到瓦尔纳，但我们可以乘火车横跨欧洲大陆更快地到达那里。我们明天出发！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">在十月一个寒冷的日子，我们离开了伦敦，四天后到达了瓦尔纳。我们作了周密的安排，只等轮船到达。每天明娜都会告诉我们，她依然可以听到流水的声音。但三个星期过去了，船还是没到。最后，消息传来——船已到达加拉茨，不来瓦尔纳了！</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们坐第一班火车去了加拉茨，但还是太晚了。箱子已不在船上。“今天早晨有人来把它取走了。”一个水手告诉我们。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们又匆忙赶回旅馆，把这个消息告诉了我亲爱的明娜，但显然她已经知道了。她的脸吓得发白。“他走了，”她平静地说，“也把我带走了。哦，我亲爱的朋友们！在我变成一个吸血鬼之前，你们一定要杀了我！你们一定要像对待可怜的露西那样来处置我，让我安息。答应我你们会为我那样做的！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我握着她的手，一句话也说不出来。如果那一天真的来了，我不知道自己该怎样熬过去。</p>
<p class="normaltext">后来，明娜睡着了，我们又做了新的打算。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“她说对了，”范赫尔辛忧郁地说，“我们可怜的明娜情况十分危急。她已经开始变了——她的牙齿越来越长，越来越尖，当伯爵侵入她的思想时，她的眼神就变得僵直而冷酷。我们必须找到并杀掉他——趁一切还不算太晚！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">以后几天的事情我几乎什么都记不得了。我既害怕又愤怒，几乎要发疯了。当得知伯爵的棺材已用船运往河的上游后，我和杰克·苏厄德还有阿瑟开始乘另一艘船追去。范赫尔辛则带着我的明娜乘坐马车，要翻过山去德拉库拉城堡。和她告别时，我的心都碎了。也许我永远也不会再见到她了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们跟着伯爵的船走了五天，但还是没有赶上。后来一些村民告诉我们，他们现在走陆路，于是我们就买了马，像风一样在黑夜里狂奔。</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天黄昏时，我们已接近德托库拉城堡了。“我们必须加快速度！”我对他们两人喊到。太阳已开始西沉，突然我看见前面路上有一些人赶着马车，而马车后面装的就是那副棺材。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我的脑子里只有一个念头——杀掉那个吸血鬼，让他永远消失。我追上马车时，杰克和阿瑟紧随着我。我从马上跳到了马车上，杰克和阿瑟则和车夫及其他人搏斗，我把棺材推到地上。棺材落下来，裂开了。德托库拉伯爵就躺在那儿，太阳的最后一束光线照在他可怕的脸上。他的眼睛里燃烧着仇恨的火焰，直直地盯着我。再过几秒钟，当太阳落山时，他就可以自由活动了。我跳到地上，高高地举起了手中的匕首，用尽全力刺向他的心脏。匕首直穿入那吸血鬼的心脏。德拉库拉伯爵发出一声凄厉的惨叫，然后就一动不动了。就在同时，太阳落了下去，我们再朝棺材里看时，里面已经空了……</p>
<p class="normaltext">山上就是德拉库拉城堡，我们很快就见到了范赫尔辛。他正匆匆地下山来找我们，我的明娜也和他在一起。我跑过去把她抱在了怀里。她可爱的脸上又充满了快乐和幸福。“好了，我亲爱的，”她轻轻地说，“我们找到了那三个女吸血鬼的墓地，她们现在已无法伤害我们了，德拉库拉也终于被除掉了！我们又可以开始新的生活了。”</p>

<h2 class="title2" id="mllj3">6．德拉库拉必须死</h2>
<p class="normaltext">第二天，我和范赫尔辛、杰克·苏厄德、阿瑟一起制定了计划。明娜也在。她非常苍白，但也想帮助我们。我们知道必须在明娜死去之前除掉德拉库拉。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“如果我们不杀掉他，”范赫尔辛说，“明娜就会死，而且将永远成为一个吸血鬼。我今天早晨又去了伯爵的家，最后一副棺材不见了。我们必须找到它。白天德拉库拉伯爵一定会待在里面。如果能在天黑之前找到他，我们就能杀死他。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“但现在它在哪呢？”我近乎疯狂地问道。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们当然不知道答案。但这时明娜说话了。“我感觉自己已经是半个吸血鬼了，有时一些奇怪的想法会侵入我的脑子。我想这些想法是来自德拉库拉伯爵的。刚才，你们说话时，我好像听到了船在水里行进的声音。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">“当然了，”范赫尔辛叫道，“德拉库拉已决定离开英国！他知道我们现在都与他为敌，他在这儿很不安全。所以他现在正返回特兰西瓦尼亚——肯定是乘船！我们必须弄清楚昨天晚上是哪一艘船离开此地开往黑海的。”</p>
<p class="normaltext">在伦敦海运事物所，我们得知前一天晚上有一艘船开往黑海的瓦尔纳。我们还听说有一位乘客在最后一刻才到——一个身穿黑色衣服，又高又瘦的男人。他脸色惨白，两眼通红，长着一张血红的嘴。他还带着一个很长的箱子！</p>
<p class="normaltext">“那么，”范赫尔辛说道，“这只船要用大约三个星期才能到瓦尔纳，但我们可以乘火车横跨欧洲大陆更快地到达那里。我们明天出发！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">在十月一个寒冷的日子，我们离开了伦敦，四天后到达了瓦尔纳。我们作了周密的安排，只等轮船到达。每天明娜都会告诉我们，她依然可以听到流水的声音。但三个星期过去了，船还是没到。最后，消息传来——船已到达加拉茨，不来瓦尔纳了！</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们坐第一班火车去了加拉茨，但还是太晚了。箱子已不在船上。“今天早晨有人来把它取走了。”一个水手告诉我们。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们又匆忙赶回旅馆，把这个消息告诉了我亲爱的明娜，但显然她已经知道了。她的脸吓得发白。“他走了，”她平静地说，“也把我带走了。哦，我亲爱的朋友们！在我变成一个吸血鬼之前，你们一定要杀了我！你们一定要像对待可怜的露西那样来处置我，让我安息。答应我你们会为我那样做的！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">我握着她的手，一句话也说不出来。如果那一天真的来了，我不知道自己该怎样熬过去。</p>
<p class="normaltext">后来，明娜睡着了，我们又做了新的打算。</p>
<p class="normaltext">“她说对了，”范赫尔辛忧郁地说，“我们可怜的明娜情况十分危急。她已经开始变了——她的牙齿越来越长，越来越尖，当伯爵侵入她的思想时，她的眼神就变得僵直而冷酷。我们必须找到并杀掉他——趁一切还不算太晚！”</p>
<p class="normaltext">以后几天的事情我几乎什么都记不得了。我既害怕又愤怒，几乎要发疯了。当得知伯爵的棺材已用船运往河的上游后，我和杰克·苏厄德还有阿瑟开始乘另一艘船追去。范赫尔辛则带着我的明娜乘坐马车，要翻过山去德拉库拉城堡。和她告别时，我的心都碎了。也许我永远也不会再见到她了。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我们跟着伯爵的船走了五天，但还是没有赶上。后来一些村民告诉我们，他们现在走陆路，于是我们就买了马，像风一样在黑夜里狂奔。</p>
<p class="normaltext">第二天黄昏时，我们已接近德托库拉城堡了。“我们必须加快速度！”我对他们两人喊到。太阳已开始西沉，突然我看见前面路上有一些人赶着马车，而马车后面装的就是那副棺材。</p>
<p class="normaltext">我的脑子里只有一个念头——杀掉那个吸血鬼，让他永远消失。我追上马车时，杰克和阿瑟紧随着我。我从马上跳到了马车上，杰克和阿瑟则和车夫及其他人搏斗，我把棺材推到地上。棺材落下来，裂开了。德托库拉伯爵就躺在那儿，太阳的最后一束光线照在他可怕的脸上。他的眼睛里燃烧着仇恨的火焰，直直地盯着我。再过几秒钟，当太阳落山时，他就可以自由活动了。我跳到地上，高高地举起了手中的匕首，用尽全力刺向他的心脏。匕首直穿入那吸血鬼的心脏。德拉库拉伯爵发出一声凄厉的惨叫，然后就一动不动了。就在同时，太阳落了下去，我们再朝棺材里看时，里面已经空了……</p>
<p class="normaltext">山上就是德拉库拉城堡，我们很快就见到了范赫尔辛。他正匆匆地下山来找我们，我的明娜也和他在一起。我跑过去把她抱在了怀里。她可爱的脸上又充满了快乐和幸福。“好了，我亲爱的，”她轻轻地说，“我们找到了那三个女吸血鬼的墓地，她们现在已无法伤害我们了，德拉库拉也终于被除掉了！我们又可以开始新的生活了。”</p>
